# Perfume Recommender System
## Overview
A recommendation system, also known as a recommender system, is a class of algorithms and techniques used in information filtering and decision-making processes. Its main purpose is to provide personalized suggestions or recommendations to users for items they might be interested in. These items could be products, services, movies, music, articles, or anything else that can be recommended based on user preferences and behavior. In this work, a perfume recommendation system will be built based on the description of the notes.
