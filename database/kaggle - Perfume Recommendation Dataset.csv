Tihota Eau de Parfum,Indult," Rapa Nui for sugar, Tihota is, quite simply, The One. The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla... perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies. It is, without a sliver of a doubt, the finest pure vanilla we've ever had the honor of carrying, and it's so beautiful it pains us to put the bottle down."," Vanilla bean, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sola Parfum,Di Ser," A tribute to the expanse of space extending from the sky to the flower and fruit laden earth below, Sola, the newest offering from DI SER and perfumer Yasuyuki Shinohara, showcases the natural flora of Hokkaido, Japan with locally sourced and sustainably harvested ingredients from DI SERs own gardens. Starting with aromatic notes of freshly harvested Hokkaido lavender, lemongrass and yuzu, the uplifting scent moves to a floral middle of Japanese rose, magnolia, geranium and jasmine before settling on a spiritual bed of frankincense and myrrh. The spiritual and meditative scent evokes an imagery of a peaceful universe in complete harmony with the bounties of nature and of peace and contentment with its generous offerings."," Lavender, Yuzu, Lemongrass, Magnolia, Geranium, Jasmine, Frankincense, Myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kagiroi Parfum,Di Ser," An aromatic ode to the ancient beauty of Japan, Kagiroi represents the changes in the shade of the dawn sky over the mountains of Hokkaido, Japan. As the dawn sky transitions through shades of purple, yellow, orange and red, this scent that showcases many ingredients used for the first time in perfumery transitions from an aromatic slightly spicy top to an earthy and woody base, representing the ebb and flow in the stages of life. The perfume opens with notes of Japanese herbs and citruses, moves to a slightly floral spicy middle and settles into a deep woody base accentuated by the use of the Hinoki cedar that dot the mountain landscapes. A deeply personal and spiritual scent, Kagiroi is a scent of shifting aromatic complexities representing transitions in the journey of life.Parfum Edition: We are honored and delighted to offer the rare and precious Parfum edition of Kagiroi, which adds to the composition a precious specimen of Japanese agarwood, which adds rich, spiritual dimensionality and a truly impressive and long-lasting drydown to this already complex and wonderful scent."," Green yuzu, green shikuwasa, sansho seed, coriander, ylang-ylang, shiso, rosewood, vetiver, hinoki, cypriol, patchouli, agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Fantasy Eau de Parfum,Montale," Velvet Fantasy is a solar fragrance where citrus and velvety fruits mingle with the elegance of rose and the gourmand femininity of violet. Thereafter, incense unveils amber and white musk to create a bewitching and wild dance. What We Think A sweet and fruity fragrance with a rich long lasting warmth. Like a decadent dessert, it starts off bringing together the bright freshness of the tangerine with some sweet berry and apple notes and the creaminess of the toffee and vanilla. The fragrance smoothly transitions into a deliciously bold blend of amber, leather, sweet vanilla and creamy woods. Absolutely mouthwatering."," tangerine,  pink pepper,  black coffee,  leather,  violet,  jasmine,  lily of the valley,  heliotrope powder,  vanilla,  amber, sandalwood,  toffee,  musk,  oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
A Blvd. Called Sunset Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," There's no way A Lab On Fire could relocate to Los Angeles and not pay tribute to L.A.'s most iconic Boulevard, home to the legendary neon-drenched rock stages of the Strip, the crashing waves of the Palisades, and everything in between. The result is A Blvd. Called Sunset, a bright, fresh, just the right amount of edgy journey across our wild and beautiful city. Bright, fresh bergamot sparkles in a smooth, salty, almond-inflected breeze, while a masculine leaning-floral blend of violet and jasmine combines with a leather that evokes the biker bars and metal clubs so famously captured in Ed Ruscha's seminal photo book. A smooth, intoxicating base of sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka goes down like a perfect mixed drink, comforting and sensual all at once. If you ever get a chance to take a trip down Sunset, there's nothing like it in the world. But the next best thing is a day spent wearing A Blvd. Called Sunset- a perfect tribute to the heart and soul of Los Angeles."," Bergamot, almond, violet, jasmine, leather, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freckled and Beautiful Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," There's no beauty quite like being young in the City of Angels- the wind in your hair, the sand between your toes, the endless possibilities for freedom and adventure in a sun-dappled, ocean-kissed paradise where the days never end and anything is possible. Freckled and Beautiful is a perfect tribute to the beauty of youth in L.A., a warm and hazy beachside floral with an unforgettable gourmand touch. It's a fragrance that highlights everything that makes A Lab On Fire Great- creamy, romantic orange blossom, the unmistakable tang of salty ocean air, and a mouthwatering and unique gourmand component- in this case, a warm milk and Petit-Beurre pastry accord that comforts and nourishes like the perfect after-school snack. Delicious and delightful, Freckled and Beautiful captures the unique jubilation of youth, and is a must-try for all lovers of A Lab on Fire's gift for floral gourmands."," Orange flower, neroli, honeysuckle, warm milk, pastry, salicylates, sandalwood, vanilla bean, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56720.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Exit the King Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," In these tumultuous times, a fragrance that celebrates destruction and dethronement might seem... risky. But Etat Libre was never about playing it safe, and Exit The King, like all their best releases, is risky in all the best ways, a you've-never-smelled-anything-quite-like-this fragrance that tears down the contours of a classical chypre to uncover a blindingly fresh, delightfully sexy new regime. An immaculate blend of contrasts: electrically overdosed florals, sparkling fresh soap foam, and the sharp green of tree moss, all set against a woodsy, milky blend of patchouli and sandalwood. It's both comfortably familiar, but thrillingly new- a modern, stylish floral that's both everyday perfect, and secret weapon good."," Timur JE, Soap Foam Accord (Aldehydes & Musk), Pink Pepper, Jasmine e-pure, Rose Superessence, Lily-of-the-valley Accord, Patchouli, Moss Absolute, Sandalwood Accord & Orcanox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/477053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eshu Extrait,PRIN," Eshu, the mischievous god of Yoruba legend, who translates between the gods and all the peoples of earth. Eshu, a groundbreaking 2000 Fall/Autumn collection from the late Alexander McQueen, which inspired Prin Lomros to create this scent. Eshu, the fragrance, a universally fluent dialogue between rich, earthy tobacco, fiery spices, sweet cognac, and touches of animalics, woods, and musk. The synthesis is surprisingly smooth, a powerful yet utterly wearable boozy tobacco with intense, sophisticated resin and spice tones, distinctive and unforgettable. An ingenious juxtaposition of traditional tribal elements and modern twists, Eshu is not to be missed."," Tobacco, hay, elemi, copaiba, olibanum, nutmeg, black pepper, castoreum, atlas cedar, oakmoss, cognac, ambroxan, norlimbanol, cinnamon, cumin seed, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Saringkarn Extrait,PRIN," A taste of love and seduction. The value of love between lover, friend and family and humanity. A taste of happiness. Saringkarn, a tribute to the traditional and ancient Thai form of literary composition, is a tantalizing and unique scent somewhere between gourmand, floral, and oriental, where dark and sensual tones of oud, amber, leather, and tobacco gain an alluring, romantic sweetness from beeswax, dark chocolate, and a bouquet of exquisite roses. Sweet, boozy prune gives a cognac-like richness, while a darker smoke note preserves just the right amount of provocative danger. Like any true work of literary genius, it's up to you how to interpret it all."," Saffron, champaca, fir balsam, beeswax, amber, damask rose, rose de mai, tobacco, leather, dark chocolate, prune, oud, musk, oakmoss, ambrette, smoke, incense, ylang ylang",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arsalan Parfum,PRIN," The Persian legend of Arsalan is a story of a royal heir who rediscovers his hidden heritage and decides to reclaim his throne. And as would befit a fragrance based on hidden power, Arsalan is a gorgeous and richly textured floral spice scent that feels warm, lush, and romantic, but also reveals an intensely potent blend of some of the finest Southeast Asian ouds available. Beneath a bright, alluring bouquet of luscious, smooth champaca and jasmine, an intense and carnal rush of Cambodian oud and Thai Trat oud displays a multifaceted profile of sweet, warm, sensual oud tones. A bright, sparkling olibanum incense plays off of an exotic spice blend, uplifting and giving sophisticated complexity. Arsalan the prince needed a long journey before he was able to reveal his nobility, but Arsalan the fragrance is undeniably, wonderfully regal."," Cambodian oud, Trat oud, jasmin sambac, champaca, olibanum, turmeric, clove, caraway, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, gardenia, opoponax, saffron, sandalwood, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nocturnal Poetry Parfum,PRIN," Who says a nightmare needs to be a bad experience? In the talented imagination of Prin Lomros, the surreal feeling that accompanies an unsettling dream is sublime inspiration. This sensation is captured to enchanting effect in Nocturnal Poetry, a lush, intoxicating floral with the spicy, animalic complexity that PRIN is known for. A cool, green and thorny bouquet of violet, champaca, and rose sits in a misty fog of incense and myrrh, kissed with sweet, earthy notes of beeswax, hay, and coffee. A dark base of oud, animalics and leather beckons with provocative mystery, but Lomros always keeps Nocturnal Poetry from becoming too unsettling- ultimately, this dreamlike floral is a journey anyone will enjoy taking."," Violet, champaca, rosewood, beeswax, frankincense, myrrh, coffee bean, rose, tobacco, hay, jasmine, leather, castoreum, hyrax, civet, musk, oud, turmeric, cumin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Homa Parfum,PRIN," Sanskrit for a sacred Hindu fire ritual, Homa is a sumptuously complex blend of spices, florals, and animalics to elevate both spirit and consciousness. Using fire as the direct messenger between humans and gods, Homa transmutes these exotic ingredients into something simultaneously rich and earthy, but also transcendent and ethereal, weaving threads of smoke, ash, ozone and incense into the fragrant blend to represent the journey of these sacred offerings into the realm of the spirits. There's more than enough sophistication to satisfy lovers of Prin's deepest, most animalic elixirs- dark oud, earthy mushroom, and (natural, cruelty-free) fossilized hyrax and goat hair lend primal intensity, but Homa is balanced with bright, sparkling airiness that make it wonderfully wearable. For those looking to commune with the heavens, Homa is a sacred ritual safe to perform anytime."," Cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, cardamom, cassia, cumin, turmeric, caraway, nutmeg, clove, saffron, hay, kaffir lime, oud, galbanum, ghee butter, jasmine, champaca, tuberose, beeswax, incense, myrrh, spikenard, costus, benzoin, ash, goat hair tincture, oud, mushroom, civet, hyrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Koala Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," A cloak of rich green velvet sweeps across the Australian horizon, the majestic eucalypt forest flattering every curve of the undulating landscape. Tucked high in the crook of a tree, the koala is oblivious to the mesmerizing views. It would rather curl into a ball and sleep off a feast of oily eucalyptus, the aromatic leaves that sustain it. Despite their sleepy demeanour and friendly expression, koalas are territorial creatures. Males mark the soaring trunks with their musk, establishing their dominance.Zoologist Koala opens with an invigorating blend of lemony honey and the sweet aroma of eucalyptus. They float above a blanket of black tea and spices, then draw you even deeper into musky amber and woods. The result is a unique and carefree scent that snuggles in around you, enveloping you in an embrace both playful and independent."," Eucalyptus, menthol honey gumdrops, mimosa, black tea, geranium, incense, spices, vetiver, musk, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme A La Rose Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Francis Kurkdjian has a talent for making masculines that balance French sophistication with modern style- classic enough to impress, cool enough to wear anywhere. And while he's already given men a sultry, evening rose with Lumiere Noire, his newest release reinvents the masculine rose as a fresh, bright, all-day sexy stunner. L'Homme A La Rose doesn't lack for floral strength, as it's built around a dynamic pair of two of the world's most renowned roses: deep, sweet Damask roses from Bulgaria, and smooth, fresh Centifolia rose from Grasse. A fruity, zesty grapefruit accord accentuates the floral roundness, while a dynamic ambery wood accord blends with aromatic sage for a contemporary, distinctive signature. A rose that any man will want atop his wardrobe, L'Homme A La Rose is a new standard for masculine florals."," Grapefruit, Damascene rose, amber woods accord, sage, Centifolia rose, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49890.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rozu Eau de Parfum,Aesop," The beauty of Aesop fragrances lies in their ability to elegantly balance between sophistication and naturalism- an Aesop scent is gorgeously refined, yet possessed with an unmistakable and primal connection to the raw materials from which it was created. So it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that their foray into rose scents is no delicate young flower, but a lush, gorgeously green wild rose with vibrant shiso accords, woods and spice, and a light touch of sophisticated smoke. The rose note is sumptuously romantic, with enough floral fullness to make any rose lover swoon, but the eastern influence of the aromatics and guaiac wood impart a soulful spirituality that set Rozu apart. A beautiful floral that's every bit an Aesop scent, Rozu is a must try for rose lovers."," Rose, shiso, guaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30156.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champs Lunaires Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," An intangible summer night; Moonlit fields of white flowers.Inspired by Serge Lutens' Tubereuse Crimenelle, and the lusty creamy fruit notes of Piguet's Fracas, Champs Lunaires, was an intense journey for perfumer Manuel Cross, a personal challenge to create a tuberose of satisfying balance -- indolic, green, buttery, creamy, realistic, uplifting."," Tuberose, White Rose Petals, Pomelo, Sandalwood, Coconut Milk, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Prends-Moi Eau de Parfum,Isabey," Take me.It's a bold and forward statement in any era, and in the early 1930's, when Isabey first released Prends-Mois (as it was called then), it was shockingly controversial- and highly coveted. Now, the iconic scent has been relaunched as Prends-Moi, and we're pleased to report the fragrance housed in the emblematic red bottle has every bit of the passionate romanticism that turned heads almost a century before. Prends-Moi opens with a fiery spark of pink pepper, leading to a lush and daring contrast of florals in the heart- a light, innocent rose intertwined with bold, unapologetically carnal tuberose. The powdered elegance of lipstick is balanced against an almost animalic cocoa, representing a seduction both sophisticated and primal. Erotic, romantic, and classic, Prends-Moi is everything French perfume should be."," Bergamot, pink pepper, raspberry, rose, red satin lipstick, tuberose, cardamom, iris, cocoa, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Cuisine Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," We've always known Hilde Soliani makes the most mouthwatering sweet scents out there, but being ""The Queen Of Gourmand"" doesn't begin and end with dessert. Eau de Cuisine, her tribute to longtime friend and renowned modern Italian chef Paolo Lo Priore, is a glorious main course of a fragrance, a spicy, savory, salty feast for the senses. A tribute to Chef Paolo's signature ""cucina convivale"" tasting experience, which emphasizes experimentation and creativity, this scent is a wonderful combination of flavors- the aquatic brine of the ocean, the sweetness of apricot and almond, the creaminess of fresh dairy, and a captivating melange of aromatic herbs and spices. It's a scent both bright and rich, lively and decadent, sure to appeal to lovers of aquatics, orientals, and gourmands alike. In other words, it's as unique as Hilde Soliani herself- not to mention her equally impressive foodie friends.","ocean, apricot, almond, fresh dairy, aromatic herbs, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Disobbedienza Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Disobedience does not have to be a bad thing. In the talented and unrestricted artistic imagination of a perfumer like Hilde Soliani, it represents risk-tasking, freedom, and creative liberation. Inspired by her time performing experimental theater, Disobbedienza is an olfactive tribute to blazing one's own path in the face of stultifying conformity. There are notes chosen for their symbolism- a black, rare rose, both dark and romantic; smoky, mysterious ash to represent the phoenix-like cycle of destruction and rebirth; and, as befitting the Queen of Gourmand, a sweet and spicy opening with the tantalizing fizz of fine champagne. As with many of Hilde's most distinctive and compelling offerings, Disobbedienza rejects easy categorization, and yet it's as wonderfully easy to wear as any of her magical creations. Break away from conformity- lose yourself in the whimsical, bold, and iconoclastic world of Disobbedienza today.","black rose, ash, champagne",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46644.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille de Tahiti Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Native to Central America, the plant of vanilla belongs to orchid family and grows in the humid tropical forests. The most vibrant of all the varieties is the Tahitensis. This vanilla is not extracted with solvents, but through a more natural and less invasive process, known as CO2 supercritical. This process preserves all the aromatic facets of its profile and ensures an extract of the highest purity. The captivating aroma of this powerful and exotic raw material brings to life the soft texture of the vanilla pod.Vanille de Tahiti is a symphony of warm, exotic and gentle sweet notes. An enveloping vanilla enriched with floral notes of ylang ylang and champaka, while enchanting warm notes of amber mingle with musk and sandalwood."," Absolute of Ylang Ylang, Absolute of Champaca, Vanilla of Tahiti CO2, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gris Charnel Eau de Parfum,BDK Parfums," Quai Saint-Bernard, near the Jardin des Plantes, the first couples arrive at the Tino-Rossi garden. As the night falls, the number of dancers increases and the bleachers fill up. Under the silver moon and the lights of the tourist barges that criss-cross the quay a few meters away, the bodies mingle to the rhythm of the music. It is then that two glances cross paths. A discreet invitation brings them to the center of the track. As if they were carried away, they dance in the heat of the night. From this hand-to-hand seduction punctuated by knowing smiles, they end up slipping away to give free flow to more carnal desires. In the early morning, the sheets give off a scent of sleepless nights, mischievous and lascivious embraces."," Fig, Black tea, Cardamom essence, Absolute of iris, Bourbon, vetiver, Sandalwood from India, Absolute of Tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/856003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milk Musk Eau de Toilette,Molton Brown," Quiet morning light gently trickles in through glazed sash glass. Billowing freshly pressed sheets on soft skin, nestled into the solacing embrace of milky notes. Comforting, warm cashmere whispers soothingly of silvery white musk as a melody of fluttery piano chords tinkle from the record player. Enjoy the tranquillity in this balance of enlivening pear, soothing musk and sensual vanilla. A unique milk accord imparts nostalgic, intimate warmth creating a space  of profound love in a private haven.Perfect for when you need to ensconce yourself in a calm, cocooning bubble, whether it's curling up with a book or a just allowing yourself a few minutes of meditation. What We Think A fresh, clean, deeply soothing musk that evokes fresh laundry and morning sunshine, enhanced with the perfect touch of mouthwatering, tonka-flecked vanilla- Milk Musk is a skin scent with a euphorically dreamlike smoothness."," pear, peach, musk, ambroxan, vanilla, white cedarwood, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/765130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blackberry Woods Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," Shay & Blue has a unique gift for playful sophistication- fragrances that can put a smile on your face and make your pulse elevate all at once. With its effortless combination of darkly sensual musky woods and glossy fruit notes, Blackberry Woods may be their most enchanting fusion yet. The delightful complexity is evident right from the start, with a sumptuous, mouthwatering harvest of sunny blackberry just bursting with joy, contrasted against a rich, green, and aromatic floral heart of neroli and lemon leaf. The aromatic sensuality carries into a base of darker, musky cypress wood, creating an alluring cocktail with a decidedly rebellious streak. If Blackberry Woods featured only the delicious blackberry opening, it would still be an instant summer favorite. What a gift, however, that this intoxicating, enchanting gem offers so much more."," Blackberry, neroli, lemon leaves, cypress",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavande Romaine Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"  At harvest time, evenings are filled with its aroma… and the sunset is colored by the newly cut flowers strewn over the fields. The humble alembics installed near the reservoirs glow with red flames into the night.Lavender is so connected to Provence that often farmers don't realize that it was introduced during the Roman invasion which gave this region the designation of ‘Provincia Romana' from which its name derives..Lavande Romaine captures the essence of these landscapes and the beauty of the lavender fields where flocks of blue butterfly's float in the air. A joyful fragrance that dances and sings a summer tune."," Lavender fine, Bleu Cedar, Cassis bourgeons, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Celestial Eau de Parfum,Electimuss," Heavenly, divine and of the gods. Gazing to the stars, the Romans were keen astronomers naming the planets after gods, and such was their belief in the power and influence of the skies over their destiny that they were also keen devotees of astrology.   The olibanum at the heart of this scent is a light, lemony incense with a conifer undertone, lifted by a spicy rose and underpinned by a warm woody base. Luminous, like the heavenly bodies which inspired it."," Saffron, raspberry, black pepper, olibanum, Indian rose absolut, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cedar, Paraguan guaiac wood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/855010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Puritas Eau de Parfum,Electimuss," Inspired by Vesta, the Roman goddess of purity, home and hearth. Her purity of heart and promise of fertility were symbolized in the eternal flames burning in her temples.  Puritas has a graceful floral incense heart, with bright, peppery top notes and a warm spicy base.  Like its inspiration this fragrance has an eternal elegance, simplicity and a lightness of touch."," Elemi, pink pepper, absinthe, olibanum, rose, Indian tuberose absolut, geranium, labdanum, patchouli, tonka and amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/855011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thurible Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes," The best kept secret about incense in perfumery is how magically versatile it is- it can be smoky, of course, but also resinous and animalic, or sparkling and fresh, or opulent and narcotic. Thurible is the rare incense scent that seems to contain it all, a wonderfully complex ode to this beloved material that still coalesces into a beautifully wearable and stylish signature. A sweet, clove-forward spice and herb blend supplements the church-ier aspects of the incense- cool, smoky, and sheer- while warmer, more resinous facets intertwine with rich, earthy labdanum and patchouli. A third chord- clean, sparkling incense with fresh rose and oakmoss- pulls everything together with a timeless twinkle. A must-smell for all incense lovers, Thurible is a comfortably sophisticated incense scent we're head over heels for."," clove, ash, sage, black pepper, labdanum, incense, rose, patchouli, leather, ambergris and moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suede Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes," Polarizing and provocative, Rook's take on leather is perhaps not as smooth as the name Suede might suggest, but for those who love animalic, realistically raw leather, there's nothing else like it. Smoky, rugged, untanned leather is the star, still recognizably charred and fleshy, harkening back to times where leather was still made by hand. It weaves in a rich tobacco leaf, earthy, sweet, and natural, like the leathermaker was sitting at his tanning bench with a rolled cigarette dangling from his lips. While a delicate undercurrent of smooth suede makes the name more than just playful irony, those who only love the most delicate leather scents may want to look elsewhere. But for those who love raw, animalic, smoky leather, this is a magic potion not to be missed."," suede, tobacco leaf, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes," When we say we love amber scents, we don't just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive ""amber"" note in perfume. Which is good, because neither ingredient is anywhere to be found in Rook's new Amber scent. What we really love, however, is the spirit of amber- powerful, sensual, spiritual, and comforting, all at once- and that, this Amber has in multitudes. It opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark. A tonka bean base adds a touch of familiar vanillic tone, but stripped of the typically creamy dessert trappings. This amber glows with the intensity of late summer dusk in the wilderness, satisfyingly sweet but also exhilarating and primal. In other words, exactly what you'd hope for from Rook."," saffron, smoke, incense, amber, maple, black musk, tonka bean and resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Interlude Black Iris Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an Iris flower by Georgia O'Keeffe, Interlude Black Iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. Just as with the original Interlude Man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original Interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, Black Iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. The intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. Richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. If Interlude Man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, Interlude Black Iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?"," Bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41899.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escale En Haiti Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables transports us to the bustling and beautiful Les Cayes region of Haiti, and their signature crop- vetiver, considered by many to be the best in all the world. Les Cayes vetiver is renowned for its richness and depth- allowed to mature beneath the soil for up to 2 years before harvesting, it develops uniquely bright, sweet citrus tones in addition to the expected earthy and woody properties. And for Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables uses a 22% concentration of the absolute finest vetiver Les Cayes has to offer: a ""Grand Cru"" distillation hand-selected from unique terroir, carefully root-harvested, and painstakingly distilled at atmospheric pressure, a slower and more expensive process that provides a richer, longer-lasting extract. The results are a stunning natural vetiver cologne with real depth, each ingredient carefully chosen to highlight an element of the extraordinary main ingredient. Electric pink pepper from Reunion Island and aromatic juniper oil from Macedonia bring a spicy, fresh burst, while rich Venezuelan tonka and Somalian myrrh essential oil add a touch of creamy, powdered elegance to the subtle but long-lasting base. Vetiver lovers looking for both freshness and disctinction- this is one you won't want to miss."," Pink pepper, juniper, Haitian vetiver, tonka bean, myrhh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escale En Indonesie Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Indonesie, Les Indemodables has chosen to showcase a spectacular specimen of one of the most precious materials in all of perfumery- ambergris. Recovered from the paradise of Sumatra, Indonesia, this top-graded white ambergris was painstakingly distilled into a ""Grand Cru"" tincture, broken down with state-of-the-art ultrasound and then carefully tinctured for over six months to achieve a sublime level of complexity. Every possible facet of this fabled material- vivid ozonic tones, sensual animalics, and electric saltiness- are fully presented, delivering a depth and longevity that are rare for an eau de cologne. And a suite of carefully chosen complementary notes add more EDC freshness- a sunny sparkle of Calabrian bergamot and Sicilian lemon combine with a green, floral freshness from Moroccan neroli oil. Each note teases out even more complexity from the ambergris, which feels as bright and refreshing as the citrus opening but soon gains creamy, seductive tonality from a smooth jasmine and sandalwood base. Don't worry if this sounds a bit heavy for an EDC, as it's delivered with a wonderfully light touch that makes it oh so wearable. But if you've ever wanted a scent that harnessed the true power of ambergris while also maintaining delightful everyday wearability, don't let this hidden gem pass you by."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, Indonesian ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Escentric 05 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," ""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza SchoenCashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees.Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules."," Fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30861.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1979 New Wave Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," As the seventies turned to the eighties, the nightlife at Bains Douches turned from the glitzy excess of disco to a new sound that was both melodic and modern, but also rawer and more emotionally intense than what had come before. As an ode to this New Romanticism and its dark and cheerful contradictions, 1979 New Wave is a truly intriguing combination of exceptionally bright, aldehydic herbaceous notes contrasted against a rich base of gorgeous, woodsy orris. The cool, bracing freshness of a mint bouquet explodes off the skin, the aldehydes providing a modern, gently soapy sparkle, which lifts up the (dare we say gloomy?) sensuality of the buttery orris heart, which otherwise might sink under its own complex richness. The smoothly musky base supports both the lighter and darker aspects of the scent, as crisp, aromatic cedarwood keeps the energy up while creamy sandalwood and warm amber coax warmer aspects from the orris. Looking for a new, sexy take on iris/orris? 1979 New Wave is here to transport you."," Peppermint, Spearmint, Aldehydes, Orris Concrete, Virginia Cedar, Australian Sandalwood, Musk, Amber Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Her colorful Hermes foulard sweeps with the breeze and you breathe deeply to catch the rich mixture of Cote d'Azur flavors, in their magic blend of floral and marine. She parks at a panoramic spot and draws out of the back of the car a basket with your breakfast. She doesn't mind sitting on the ground, she bought her lovely dress at the market stalls for a few dollars and it is not worth worrying about. What a woman! - you think - she can match a few-dollar-dress with such an astonishing pearl necklace. You open a bottle of Beaujolais wine and lean towards her to pour some wine into her glass. You can't help stopping pouring wine and close your eyes, as you smell her perfume. So much in line with her, with her style: sweet and mellow, a mixture of flowers and fruit and some hints of vanilla at the base."," Coastal Breeze accord, Muguet, Ivy Leaves, Mediterranean Marjoram, Mimosa, Almond Flower, White Rose, Ylang-Ylang Nosy Be, Saffron Flower, Cedarwood Virginia, Benjoin Siam, Oakmoss, Silky Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/640013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Magnolia Grandiflora - Michel Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Michel Roudnitska's expressive, sensuous compositions are few and far between. An accomplished photographer and fervent traveler, he has all but given up commercial perfumery to dedicate himself to other pursuits. But when he met Saskia Havekes, a renowned Australian floral designer, he offered her – and perfume lovers – a priceless gift: the formula of a magnolia fragrance inspired by the magnolia tree in his parents', now his, garden near Grasse. The scent he had worked on for his own pleasure had found a home at Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Michel is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by the late Sandrine Videault, whose mentors were Michel's parents Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se Roudnitska.While Sandrine's magnolia is fresh and shimmering, Michel's interpretation expresses the flower in its full bloom, with its lush waxy petals.

Everything is building into an oud that plays off sweet and lush alike with smoky and creamy facets, imparting an almost mystical elegance.

Mad About You Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Composed in 2017 for ""The Kiss"" art exhibition, Mad About You is a seductive and surprisingly complex fragrance inspired by the humor and discordance of neo-romanticism and love in the age of social media.

Of course, with a lovely, fun, and sophisticated scent like this in your arsenal, we have a feeling that first meet-up is going to go just fine."," Black tea, licorice, red fruits, lipstick, violet, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/545017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anti-Blues,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," ""In the paintings of Jacques Monory, blue forgives everything. It makes the crime aesthetic, the threat fascination. Bathed in shades of highly desirable blue, urban and contemporary violence paradoxically becomes hypnotic.""Anti-Blues, the first in Pierre Guillaume's new Confidentiel series, is a dark gourmand that, like the paintings of Monory, bathes warm mineral and woody gourmand notes in a cool blue wash of frankincense, combining the dangerous and the delicious. The frankincense is stark and cold, mixed with an almost alien vetiver, disguising the imposing woody bitterness coming from cacao, saffron, and amyris. Touches of hay and dark chocolate coax out the animal nuances of vanilla, already dirtied with leather and tobacco. It's a fragrance of olfactory illusion, enticing edible notes and seductive woods painting a distinctly tinted portrait of delectable darkness."," Dark chocolate, saffron, grapefruit, incense, resin, amyris, cacao wood, hay, tobacco, vetiver, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/545018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Fuyu Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the delicate juiciness of a Japanese fuyu persimmon, Fuyu is a floral skin musk of unique refinement and subtle yet indescribable pleasure. It opens on an accord of exceptional cleverness- white peach providing the sophisticated sweetness and cedarwood delivering a subtly creamy woodsiness that together create the illusion of a soft, perfectly ripe persimmon. The heart notes quickly unfold, revealing a bouquet of beguilingly powdery iris set against a luscious jasmine that keeps the fruity tones balanced. And all is laid softly on a bed of pillowy musks that surround the skin, softening, soothing, and purring with gentle sensuality. It's a true beauty of a skin scent, as perfect for iris lovers as it is for fans of subtly fruity musks- a fragrance with minimal intensity, but maximum complexity, and one that proves that Tom Daxon's talents extend to every aspect of fragrance."," White peach, jasmine, iris, soft musks, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62632.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perfumista Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," In a world where artistry is ever more commoditized and luxury so often conflated with price, individuality is the rarest treasure- the ""luxury of being yourself."" That's the promise of Perfumista, a fruity, woody floral beauty that evokes some of the grand feminine chypres of years past, yet glows with the unique loveliness that infuses all of Anatole Lebreton's creations.

DOULEUR! - an oxidized rose”Douleur means ""pain, "" which is a seemingly appropriate name for a fragrance created in collaboration with UK tattoo artist and bondage master Freddie Albrighton. But fear not- Douleur understands the intersection of pleasure and pain,  and this uniquely bright,  sweet,  minty metallic rose is as utterly compelling as it is unexpected,  blending modern and gothic influences to feel both wholly Bogue,  and yet also like a departure from Gardoni's typical vintage-influenced animalic florals.

Ambre Stone Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In Ambre Stone, a juicy burst of bergamot takes an autumnal and sensual turn with the earthy addition of patchouli, rich sandalwood with a hint of indolic jasmine. But it's real ambergris that takes this scent to a whole new level, sprinkling the composition with that ingredient's inimitable fairy dust, adding warmth, coziness, and sensuality like the golden light of an autumn sun on a picturesque summer scene.Due to its rarity and cost, ambergris (grey amber), the aged and oxidized exudate from a whale””at once sweet, earthy, marine and animalic””is largely found in synthetic form in perfume. But this almost mythic ingredient is in a 5% dose in Ambre Stone, adding a dreamy sensuousness to the edges of the fragrance's brightness. As with all ingredients sourced by L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res, the lump of ambergris is first selected from a trusted partner. Then, Jean Philippe Paris, AFDM's scientific director, processes the ambergris for around six months into a tincture or infusion, until it is deemed, along with the evaluation of perfumer Antoine Lie, to be ready to use. Ambre Stone, by the time it dries down, is a skin scent of voluptuous beauty that will have you inhaling yourself with abandon."," Ambergris infusion, Indonesian Patchouli oil, Egyptian Jasmine absolute late crop, Moroccan Neroli oil, Indian Sandalwood oil, Italian Bergamot oil late crop",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

It smells pretty sexy over here."," Madagascan vanilla olÃ©orÃ©sin, Somalian Olibanum, Madagascan Clove bud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bergamote de G. Franco Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In a tiny area of Reggio in Calabria Italy, around the strait of Messina, crops provide the bergamot oil so crucial to perfumery, lending its bright, luscious, aromatic citrus qualities to untold number of fragrances.

Franco is combined with the sun-drenched honeyed mimosa flower, along with delicately sweet osmanthus, with its tea and apricot facets. In addition to the creaminess mimosa imparts, Kashmirin saffron gives Bergamote de G. Franco a leathery note, adding to the scent's subtle complexity. Sunny and elegant with gravitas, Bergamote de G.

Vetiver de Pierre Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In Les Cayes, Haiti, vetiver roots with their dry, earthy notes are laid out in front of L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res partner Pierre LÃ©ger's factory where the prized ingredient will be distilled. That earthy scent quality is amplified in Vetiver de Pierre in one of its two acts.

Jasmin de Cherifa's real jasmine will take you on a journey of the flower's scent life cycle and in the process, taking your breathe away...Cherifa was asked to use the flowers from their fields' early, middle, and late crops to provide the full olfactive spectrum of the jasmine they harvest from June to October. Early jasmine, from June and July, is fresh and fruity. It turns floral and creamy midway through, in August, maturing into an animalic, indolic beauty in September. And that, along with an Egyptian rose absolute centifolia and a creamy Indian sandalwood to sing in its chorus, is what you get.Velvety, fruity, creamy, and sensuous, with a surprise touch of clary sage for added brightness and dimension, Jasmin de Cherifa is a revelation demonstrating that its simplicity of construction makes it even more elegant and luxurious. As Oscar Wilde once said,“I'm a man of simple tastes. I'm always satisfied with the best.”"," Egyptian Jasmine absolute Grand Cru, Egyptian Rose absolute centifolia Grand Cru (also from Cherifa's fields), Indian Sandalwood Grand Cru",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Love YY,Bogue Profumo," I LOVE YY is Antonio Gardoni's dual declaration of love- first, to New York City, a place he fell over heels for from his very first visit. But that title isn't a typo- YY, another object of his affection, is short for Ylang Ylang, that uniquely big, open, complex floral known for all the ways it smells unlike any other flower- sometimes grassy, sometimes gourmand, sometimes woodsy and resinous. When we asked Antonio to make us an exclusive fragrance to celebrate the opening of our first NYC boutique, he connected NY and YY, and the rest was a match made in heaven- or, at least, in the heart of Nolita.And leave it to Antonio to construct a fragrance that truly captures the energy and beauty of NYC. I LOVE YY is a whirlwind of delightful chaos, with perfect touches of New York everywhere you look- cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. The titular ylang note is camphorous and lactonic, joining tonka, rose, and jasmine to feel sweet and rich, buzzing like a packed after-hours party. Cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. An edgy violet leaf recalls the flashbulbs and fluorescents of a hot new gallery opening in the Meatpacking District. And all of these notes intertwine in a glorious hum of energy, light, sweetness and intoxicating depth that can only represent one single, gigantic, overwhelming, wonderful city. We couldn't be more excited that Antonio Gardoni and Bogue chose to join us in our inaugural NYC adventure. Won't you come with us?"," Ylang ylang, grapefruit, jasmine, rose, tonka, violet leaf, vanilla, benzoin, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
New York Eau de Parfum,Widian," New York City in the spring may be the most magical place in the world. For once a year, the electric bustle of the city is balanced with delightfully mild temperatures, gentle sunshine, and a fresh breeze that draws even the most cynical citydwellers out into New York's beautiful and far-flung public spaces, now teeming with the energy of new life. This is the inspiration for New York, the latest in Widian's tribute to the great cities, an explosion of bright citrus, spicy florals, and musky woods that positively vibrates with the extraordinary dynamism of the Big Apple. All the energy of a New York spring is present from the very first spray, as New York bursts forth with sun-soaked notes of lemon, bergamot, and mandarin, kissed with a burst of pink pepper. The spicy, aromatic bouquet only grows richer in the romantic heart notes, as striking floral notes of lavender, geranium and rose are combined with coriander and juniper, conjuring a lusciously fresh and deeply sensual tone. And as the smooth, ambered base of tobacco, musk, and never-too-heavy vanilla emerges, you can practically feel the sun setting, and a nighttime of endless possibilities on the horizon. It's just another perfect spring day in the greatest city in the world."," Bergamot, mandarin, lemon, pink pepper, lavender, coriander, juniper, geranium, orris, rose, akigala, jasmine, patchouli, caramel, vetiver, cypriol, white musk, white amber, vanilla, ambergris, olibanum, tonka, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/709015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold II Sahara Parfum Extrait,Widian," Like its companion fragrance Gold I, the luminous, captivating Gold II (now presented as Gold II Sahara) is built around the fragrance accord most associated with the precious metal- amber. But while Gold I's amber was powerful and opulent, Sahara is luxuriously smooth, a floral musk with a deep, soft muskiness that evaporates the concerns and trivialities of everyday life in a wondrous cloud of creamy, gently powdery sensuality.On the very first spray of Sahara, a remarkably uplifting opening of bright citrus, rich saffron and spicy elemi invigorates, before the softness of the rose and orange blossom heart steadies the tempo and soothes the soul. In the deep, sweet base, creamy vanillic amber and musky cedarwood relax and seduce. The beauty of gold is its versatility, the ability to dazzle with subtlety as easily as with excess. In Gold II Sahara, Widian chooses that subtle road less traveled, and you're sure to go along for the journey."," Saffron, orange, elemi, rose, orange blossom, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bengale Rouge Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Inspired by the stunning, tiger-like dappling of shade and light on the fur of her Bengal cat Mimi, Liz Moore's latest creation is a soft, cozily-spiced oriental that's as sensuous as a cat in full stretch. Miles away from the overt sexuality of Salome, Bengale Rouge's only hint of the animalic is the honeyed, fuzzy glow of the resins, which give the perfume a sensual warmth that's more kitten than tiger. Bengale Rouge dips a soft, attar-like rose and sandalwood into a doughy, rooty iris and wraps it all up in a halo of headily-spiced resins. It's simply gorgeous. With its benzoin-rich vanilla swirled with caramelized labdanum, clove-scented opoponax, and the citrusy brightness of a Turkish rose, Bengale Rouge at first appears to take up the glittering mantle of the great orientals of the past, such as Shalimar and Opium. However, we are steered away from the powdered classicism of these perfumes by the clever addition by the perfumer of a dollop of edible vanilla that lends the scent a modern gourmand vibe that will have you wanting to lick your own skin. The vanilla gourmand aspect doesn't dominate; but neither does the dry and spicy resin facet – they dance and intertwine like perfect halves of one whole for a golden, opulent effect that perfectly mimics the interplay of light and dark on Mimi's fur coat. It's a total love from us. What We Think A ravishing blend of warm, powdery gourmand and gently animalic notes to delight and seduce in equal measure."," Turkish rose, orris, sandalwood, sweet myrrh (opoponax), oakmoss, honey, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/665006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

We bet you can picture it just from reading the words- the sweet, mouthwatering aroma of cream and sugar diffused into the crisp snap of cold, with the subtly savory crunch of waffle cone ever present in the background. It's that simple but oh so nostalgic tableau that Hilde has created with Avatar, inspired by Paolo Brunelli, proprietor of Compagnia Gelatieri, and as with all of her marvelous gourmands, the magic isn't in unnecessary embellishments or needless complication, but in the sheer alchemy of how perfect the facsimile is- the milky, sugary, crisply cool ice cream is pitch perfect, evoking immediate memories of childhood summers and palaces of frozen delight. The Queen of Gourmand has done it again."," Caramel, sugar, milk, biscuits",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46642.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Midnight Saffron Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," Lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. Midnight Saffron, born of Tom Daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. As the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of France and Bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. As Midnight Saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. As we mentioned at the top, Midnight Saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are."," Saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dolls Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit," ""A fragrance carried by vivid, extravagant colours and a surrealistic story about uncompromising love: all consuming and bordering insanity. A heavy perfume, based on animalistic notes interrupted by the subtle and light smell of snow; so repulsive in smell, so attractive in colours, so unreal.""Dolls, a beautifully stylized fever dream of a movie directed by Japanese icon Takeshi Kitano, tackles themes of love, death, sacrifice, and freedom- complex issues that its namesake scent more than lives up to. Dolls the fragrance is every bit as abstract and experiential as its inspiration, delivering extreme but balanced bursts of animalic musks, rich florals, sweet woods, and a fuzzed-out snowflake accord that shrouds the composition in a mysterious cloak of cold freshness. This is not a scent to passively wear out on the town, but a true companion piece to a film that defies easy interpretation but delivers exceptional rewards to those with the soul to proceed. Enjoy it accordingly."," Cherry blossom, geranium, davana, orange blossom, ylang ylang, apple blossom, rose, sweet maple accord, musk, snow flake accord, ambergris, cedar, animalic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opale Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," Truly a breath of fresh air, Opale is a gem of a marine floral that evokes the sun-drenched gardens and sparkling waters of the Mediterranean coast. From the very first spritz, a symphony of gentle florals flits through the air, combining the soft purity of jasmine and lilac with delicately spicy and earthy notes of hawthorne and geranium. But the core of the scent is an oh-so-oceanside note of fresh, salty, ozonic seaweed that wraps around a smooth and lively white musk to create a pitch-perfect image of a relaxing coastal breeze, which lingers for hours thanks to touches of woodsy and gourmand notes to accentuate and enrich the authentically oceanic tang. Carefree, lively, and joyful, Opale is an aquatic scent for the romantic in us all."," Jasmine, lilac, hawthorne, geranium, seaweed, white musk, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poudrextase Eau de Parfum,Marlou," With a name that combines the French words for ""powder"" and ""ecstasy, "" it's not difficult to imagine what Marlou has in mind with their newest fragrance. But concept alone can't do justice to Pourdrextase; after all,  this is Marlou we're talking about here,  a line that does one thing- intensely erotic,  deeply animalic musk- and does it just about better than anyone. And even if their smolderingly over-the-top previous releases have been a bit too intense for you,  we'd strongly encourage you to try again,  as Poudrextase explores a duality of skin scents- on one hand,  the primal musk,  on the other,  the fresh powder and minimal florals of expensive cosmetics on clean skin- and the result is Marlou's most wonderfully accessible scent yet. Here,  the rice powder is bright and fresh,  almost citrussy,  and the dried rose just delicately sweet enough to smooth out the funk of the animalics,  which retain every ounce of the full-bodied carnality of Marlou's previous gems. It's very much a portrait of skin in full- the proper and the profane,  the clean and the dirty. We're entranced."," Rice powder, dried rose, cypress, civet, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Single Man Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit," It is the gay man that got me curious, troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other; Followed by numbness, routine, sorrow and perhaps another kind of awakening. It is a fragrance based on a variety of woody notes such as violet wood, cashmere wood, mahogany and cedar wood; that reflects the man who constructs or reconstructs a personality to bear the weight of loss, and whom society will not permit to grieve. – MARK BUXTON, perfumer What We Think Humming with restrained intensity, Single Man features a rich accord of dry, resinous woods and dark spice, freshened slightly with a semisweet, oily citrus note. It's a quietly powerful scent for those who don't want to fill the room but still want to make a statement."," Cardamom, Ginger Oil, Red Pepper, Winter Lemon Oil, Nutmeg, Rose, Elemi Oil, Violet Wood, Cashmere Wood, Oakmoss, Amber, Patchouli, Mahogany, Cedar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Whisky Oud Parfum Concentration,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Rich, smooth, and indulgent, Whisky Oud is the height of masculine luxury. In this enchanting elixir, the sweet booziness of a pitch perfect note of scotch whiskey blends seductively with a perfect base of smooth, supple leather and deep, powerful oud for a fragrance that exudes pure, powerful elegance.

Lambrosc Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Lambrusco is having a moment. Dry, crisp, sweet, and gently sparkling, this fun and fizzy wine from Hilde Soliani's native Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy has overcome its image as a cheap, mass-produced wine to become a worldwide sensation. Perfect as an aperitif, able to be paired with nearly any meal, Lambrusco is finally gaining recognition as a versatile, wonderful wine. With Lambrosc, Hilde recreates the effervescent joy of a perfect Lambrusco di Sorbara, the most sophisticated of Lambruscos, bursting with juicy berry flavor perfectly balanced against dry, sweet floral tones. Just like the real thing, Lambrosc is a perfect treat for any occasion- fun and relaxed enough for everyday wear, but elegant and bold in a formal setting. In other words, there's really no reason not to enjoy it as soon as possible."," Sweet red fruits, red wine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46641.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Donna Sentenza Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Donna Sentenza was born of a joke Hilde Soliani shared with famed Italian butcher, Simone Fracassi, about her possibly slipping on a banana peel. Hilde Soliani slip on a banana peel? Never! Donna Sentenza, the perfume, has the same zany sense of humor and zest for life as Hilde Soliani herself. Known for her special touch with gourmandise, Soliani now turns her attention to banana, making a perfume that's so fun that we all want in on the joke.  Banana milkshake. Banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York. Banana cream pie. When life is getting you down, why not take a break from it all and put a smile back on your face with this deliciously milky banana concoction? Donna Sentenza smells exactly like banana pudding, with layers of banana sandwiched with whipped cream, sugar, and a hint of smoky Nilla wafers around the edges. All good fun, of course, but underpinning it all is Soliani's seriously good vanilla, the buttery, high quality stuff that makes you want to bite your own arm. Nobody does a cream note quite like Soliani, and now we're convinced of her special banana powers too. So, if you want to smell like banana pudding from time to time (and honestly, who doesn't?) but insist on it being a super high-end, artisanal banana pudding with no nasty aftertaste, then look no further than Hilde Soliani's Donna Sentenza. It's literally the (banana) bomb."," Banana, cream, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46640.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Manteuse Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A play on words combining the deadly praying mantis with the french word for ""deceiver, "" Manteuse is quite clearly not meant to be a gentle fragrance. Instead,  this bold new floral from Stephane Humbert Lucas is a swaggering,  sensuous throwback to the unapologetic musky florals of the 1990s,  strong,  warm,  and utterly mesmerizing. Opening with a rich,  vivid blast of bergamot and bright white florals,  Manteuse stuns its prey before injecting its poison,  a deeply narcotic,  languorous blend of sweet honey and rich,  resin-flushed iris. As the deeply powdery,  smoothly seductive base of woodsy musks takes hold,  we find ourselves utterly paralyzed,  gripped with uncontrollable pleasure,  defenseless against the gorgeous power of the scent. For those who still long for bold,  sexy fragrances meant to unapologetically turn heads,  Manteuse is bound to be your newest obsession."," Bergamot, white flowers, leather, honey, iris, labdanum, sandalwood, smoked vanilla, shangrilade musk, oppoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/655015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Against Nature Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. Like the journey of Huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. Intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul. Vivid and intriguing, this is most certainly not a scent for everyone- something Huysmans would most certainly approve of."," Pink pepper, lemon, juniper, green notes, metal, jasmine, ylang ylang, lacquer, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cornaline Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," When Anatole Lebreton conceptualizes a new fragrance, we sit up and take notice. After all, his brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging or signature notes- a Lebreton scent is a uniquely formed work of art, with rustic, romantic and fantastical elements all hypnotically intertwined to create scents that stand alone as works of individual creativity. Cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, Lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. Cornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color. First, geranium shines forth with spicy assertiveness, followed by an energetic vibration of orris, and a fruit-inflected, beautifully sweet ylang ylang. Now, the fruits and florals explode forth, painting a vivid mural of springtime delights with distinct touches of hyacinth and ""belle du jour"" mirabilis, a perfect blend of spicy and fruity. And finally, an increasingly sensual bed of musk and vanilla glows with the poised relaxation of twilight. Joyful yet masterfully restrained, opulent yet luminous, Cornaline is another opus from one of niche perfume's brightest lights."," Carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bluebijou Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," For far too long, ""blue"" has been used to describe the most generic of fragrances- blandly masculine, synthetically aquatic, outright boring. But blue is so much more interesting than that- a blue scent should be hypnotically deep, harmoniously balanced, compellingly full of life. Enter Bluebijou, a unique, vibrant, unrestrained reinterpretation of the blue scent. Instead of scratchy, synthetic freshness, Bluebijou delivers juicy, sumptuous blueberry, bright violet, rich cocoa, and unmistakable truffle, all atop an impossibly deep base of dark oud and deeply boozy cognac. It's sweet, smooth, juicy and magical- and you'll never look at an underwhelming ""blue"" department store scent the same."," Violet, blueberry, cacao, truffle, tobacco, dark chocolate, cognac, oud, cashmeran, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kiviskin Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," Inspired by the beauty of luxury leather goods, Kiviskin is a bracingly fresh, invigoratingly natural-feeling scent, painting a bold portrait of spice, tobacco and suede. A richly tingling blend of saffron, nutmeg and pimento opens with vibrant energy and airy brightness, leading into a fresh, wild tobacco note with ample tonalities of spicy green, as if the plant is still firmly rooted in the field. As the leather emerges, buttressed with unsweetened dark chocolate and resinous benzoin, the result is a leather fragrance with unquestionable depth but dynamic natural freshness, and a interpretation of leather we're pleased to say we've never before experienced. Authentically deep, intriguingly modern, Kiviskin is a leather that only Piotr Czarnecki could give us."," Saffron, nutmeg, pimento, violet, tobacco, dark chocolate, benzoin, cedar, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Venom of Angel Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," Easy to love, impossible to forget, Venom of Angel is a mouthwatering and unique coconut gourmand with a surprisingly original depth. Inspired by the feeling of first entering a world-class nightclub, Venom of Angel captures the rush of light, sound, and adrenaline from the first sniff, as energetic green aloe vera and crackling black pepper burst forth, leading into a richly intoxicating cocktail of sweet, boozy rum and a wildly sexy coconut-cedar accord, creamy, spicy, and powerful. Whispers of smokey sacramental incense add mystery and deepen the allure, while a decadent white chocolate note adds an undeniable aphrodisiac quality. Part innocence, part decadence, Venom of Angel is among the most seductive scents we've smelled in quite some time."," Coconut, olibanum, black pepper, aloe vera, sugar cane, rum, ivy, cedar, white chocolate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hili Eau de Parfum,Widian," A lush flower garden surrounding extraordinarily preserved structures and sites dating back to the Bronze Age, the Hili Archaeological Park and Gardens is one of the true treasures of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Drawing inspiration from the magical location, Hili, the latest from Widian's Velvet Collection, is a stunning floral oriental that captures the delicate beauty of the gardens and the intriguing mysteries of the historic site in one compelling fragrance.Hili opens with a vibrantly colorful burst of bergamot and pink pepper, laced with a balanced strain of coriander and cinnamon. The floral heart, the true star of the show, blooms with delicate lushness, the jasmine and tuberose soft and non-indolic, the ylang and tiare sweet and gently powdered, all atop a base of smooth woods and a distinctively creamy coconut milk that the ethereally smooth florals sink into with seamless grace. All told, it perfectly represents the gardens it models itself on: a work of dreamlike beauty, expertly engineered to seem effortless."," Bergamot, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, jasmine, tuberose, ylang ylang, tiare, amber, vanilla, coconut milk, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar, tobacco leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Niral Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Neela Vermeire has always been a line of unmatched elegance, where the rich cultural heritage of India and the refinement of western perfumery go hand in hand to create enchanting, delightful fragrances. Niral, from a Hindi word and name connoting uniqueness and serenity, is inspired by Sir Thomas Wardle, a 19th-century expert in the sericulture and the Indian wild silk trade, and so it's only appropriate that the fragrance is a stunningly smooth blend of florals, spices and musks that's as silky as they come. Opening with a refined iris, smoothed with tea and liqueur notes to balance earthy, papery and floral in perfect equilibrium, Niral gently reveals a luxuriously rich, yet subtle heart of rose, spice and musks, atop an equally serene base of precious woods and supple leather. Like Sir Thomas's silk, which was used by the eras most prestigious designers and textile artists, it's sheer textural delight, softness and sophistication all in one, and a melding of the most elegant techniques that both India and Europe have to offer- you won't want to miss it."," Iris, pink pepper, tea, Turkish rose, green wine lees, cabreuva, angelica seed, ambrette seed, cardamom, leather, magnolia, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
London Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Sapphire Collection, a new collection by Widian, formerly AJ Arabia, is the perfect fusion of East meets West. The East: Widian, an Arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of Sheikh Zayed's Grand Mosque and the modern Arab spirit in the city of Abu Dhabi. The West: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest Western cities, such as London, Paris, and New York. Traditional Arabic perfumery meets Western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, East and West. London is Widian's first entry in the Sapphire Collection, and it nails the East-meets-West theme with aplomb. On the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. But the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the Far East sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from London and towards the East. Its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the Arabian Peninsula.  Simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to London, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when Eastern exoticism meets Western polish. London truly is a winning proposition."," Oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Buonissimo Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Ask anyone what their fondest scent memory is, and chances are, the scent of baking bread will be invoked. For Luckyscent's 15th anniversary, our most inventive gourmand nose, Hilde Soliani, created her loveliest, most nostalgia-inducing scent, exclusively for us - Buonissimo. Imagine waking up in a charming Italian town over a simple breakfast of a hot cup of foamed cappuccino and a freshly baked sweet pastry. The fantastical Hilde brings this vision to life in the form of what the Italians call brioche- the fair lovechild between a flaky French croissant and clasically airy French brioche. It's perfectly buttery, and fluffy with a sugared vanilla. But it wouldn't be a Hilde Soliani without that how-did-she-do-that element, and here, she's captured the sweet egg wash over the pastries' gentle slopes, caramelized a crispy golden brown from the oven.  And don't forget - from beginning to end, like every proper Italian day, the dark swirl of espresso and cream is ever-present, lending its mature sophistication. This is a serious must have for any gourmand connoisseur.","vanilla, cream, cappuccino",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46639.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Boronia Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Boronia is a very unusual fruity-floral composition based around a small, shrubby flower native to Western Australia, the eponymous boronia. Some varieties of the shrub can smell warm and woodsy, but this particular variety smells fruity and spicy, like a handful of ripe apricots dusted in cinnamon and lemon peel. There is even a minty freshness to the topnotes reminiscent of cassis leaf. The boronia also lends the perfume an ionone-rich feel, the silvery powder of violets and iris joining with a distinctive plum jam note to create an almost winey floral bouquet. The hay-like tones of a golden immortelle provide a textured backdrop to the florals, giving the scent a pleasantly rustic, early fall harvest feel: dried grass, hay, tobacco leaves turning to brown paper in the sun, and the dusty red earth of the Australian outback. Black tea and apricots create a suede impression, but it's a credit to the perfumer that the foodier notes of caramel, fruit, and cognac are never allowed to turn Boronia into a gourmand. It is fruity and rich, yes, but balanced by the tannic sharpness of tea and hay, the scent manages to stay elegantly dry. If you love the autumnal, plummy darkness of chypres such as Voleur de Roses and Mon Parfum Cheri Par Camille, then you will love Boronia too."," Boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambilux (formerly 50ml d'Ambiguite) Eau de Parfum,Marlou," Ambilux is ambiguous only in the sense that it is puzzling that a list of largely plant-based spices, resins, and florals adds up to something so unapologetically animal. The first blast has our eyes rolling back in pleasure: a thickly furred musk redolent of warm animal, dripping tallow candles, and the salty skin of a loved one. That there are new perfumes out there that dare to challenge the great Muscs Khoublai Khan and Musc Tonkin is a pleasant surprise. Although Ambilux is quite different to these perfumes, it possesses the same earthy, no-holds-barred sensuality and a texture that is distinctly retro in its velvety thickness. The creator intended for this perfume to reflect the unique olfactory fingerprint we all carry, our own personal aroma, imprinting onto others as we touch, kiss, and make contact. But like its distant progenitor, L'Air de Rien, it also captures the smells of our nest: dusty spaces, books, pots overflowing with flowers, and old wood.  Despite the listed notes, what we predominantly pick up is a warm, oily sheep's wool nuance – waxy and lanolin-like, deeply inviting to the touch. Costus root is what gives the perfume its arousing animal fattiness, but it is used subtly here, woven into the other notes for an effect that is intimate but not uncomfortably close. The sweet, slippery feel of the woolen musk is cut with a bright, almost briny ylang note, aerating the heart with a salty breeze. In the drydown, castoreum gives us nuances of dry, smoky tobacco and leather. Ambilux captures all the grimy intimacy of our own bodies, our loved ones, and the crawl spaces of our inner sanctum: it's sexy, but also comfortable and elegant.     Update: Ambilux is a new version of the beloved 50ml d'Ambiguite, made a bit lighter, warmer, and more wearable while retaining all the animalic sensuality of the original.)"," Pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grimoire Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," A Grimoire: an ancient word for an ancient tome of spells, a sacred text, powerful in the right hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Anatole Lebreton invites us to imagine such a volume, weathered by age and coated in dust, at the center of an overgrown cabin, invisible to all but the trained eye. An open window lets just the faintest sliver of light inside, along with the scents of green moss climbing the walls and a well-cultivated garden of herbs and spices, essential for the creation of magical objects. Dense clouds of incense dance in the light-beam, hinting at secrets unknowable, power as-of-yet untapped, waiting in a realm directly above and below our own. Warm, rich woods from the cabin walls and dusty paper from the pages of the book give rich body to the unique aroma inside, comforting but imposing, like a warm embrace you might never emerge from. An incense fragrance well beyond the confines of the modern world."," Bergamot, basil, lavender, elemi, olibanum, Atlas cedar, cumin, patchouli, moss, muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Decay Of The Angel Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," This is a memorizing, burnt bouquet of exotic flowers inspired by Yukio Mishima's 1971 posthumously published novel, The Decay of The Angel. Like all of Timothy Han's creations, the highest level of natural ingredients are used here, and Han's artistic vision presents a smart,  deeply affecting fragrance that walks us through the 5 stages of a falling angel: decay, diaphoresis, dirt, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, darkness.Han's olfactive interpretation of an angelic fall starts with mandarin doused rose, ylang, and neroli. The fresh opening is contrasted with a heart of indolic jasmine, ripe and just starting to wilt. Its gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along with smoldering cade, oud and cedar woods.Â  Patchouli, tonka and labdanum add a dimension of soft earthiness.A sensual intermingling of hedione and musk float throughout the charred dry-down, contrasting heavenly veneration and human desires. Dazzling, challenging, and alluring, The Decay of The Angel makes a strong argument for the sensual perks of mortality."," Mandarin, neroli, rose, ylang-ylang, frankincense, sambac jasmine, acacia, cade, oud, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dryad Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Liz Moores, perfumer behind Papillon Perfumes, lives in a house deep inside the New Forest, surrounded by a menagerie of children, horses, and animals that she has rescued and nurtured. Given that the forest forms a protective ring around Liz and her animals, it makes sense that Dryad feels like her most personal perfume yet, inspired as it is by the nymphs said to dwell in oak trees according to Greek mythology. Dryad is a sylvan fantasy of friendly trees linking their branches together to form a sunlit, green canopy over your head. Although far sexier and more ruggedly outdoorsy than anything from Guerlain or Dior, fans of vintage Vol de Nuit and Miss Dior will still feel a thrill of recognition at Dyrad's damp, mossy heart of galbanum, narcissus and an overdose of genuine oakmoss. Smoky, tough galbanum and clary sage add a resinous, rubbery dry warmth to the moistness of the green heart, and there is a touch of sun-burnt hay by way of deer tongue, a plant rich in coumarin and vanilla, and often used to flavor tobacco. Costus and apricot add a sly hint of naughty inner thigh – but just a hint. Dryad is a shamanic, witchy, but also relaxed scent that coaxes open the rigidly classical lines of the classic green chypre, ushering in sunlight, herbs, and a bunch of bright aromatics. The result is a Green Goddess of a fragrance, and the first green chypre that belongs more in the forest than in the boardroom."," cedrat, bigaradier orange, bergamot, narcissus, oakmoss, jonquil, clary sage, orange blossom, lavender, orris, vetiver, thyme, galbanum, costus, tarragon, apricot, benzoin, peru balsam, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme Accompli Eau de Parfum,Divine," Yann Vasnier has done it again. A fresh, bone-dry masculine leather, L'Homme Accompli exudes quiet class from every pore. Opening on the classic snap of a Farina-style eau de cologne, the bristle of herbs and lemon soon dies back to reveal a musky, violet leaf-driven leather that will bring tears to the eyes of the vintage Fahrenheit lover. It is at once a familiar and elegant smell – signature scent worthy for the man who is sure of his place in the world. Bolstered by a musky Atlas cedar, L'Homme Accompli's leather accord has tremendous body and presence, while managing to skip all the sweet, gouty richness of modern masculine leathers. And it's that lightness of touch that makes this fragrance so special - the air and space that Vasnier has injected into its structure allows room to breathe. L'Homme Accompli grows ever drier and darker as time passes, the herbs and violet leather curling up under the smoke of styrax resin and guaiac wood, and finishing in a salty whisper of beach amber. If Cary Grant were a fragrance, he would be L'Homme Accompli."," Amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, atlas cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Madera Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," For years now, Omnia's Madera has been one of our reference gourmand scents- a sumptuous, mouthwatering butterscotch-vanilla-caramel delight that turns heads and entices those in its trail. Now, Omnia returns to one of their greatest hits with a fresh new take, supplementing the warm sweetness we love with a crisp, fresh, spicy new heart that ignites the senses and reinvents a classic. While the fragrance still opens with the instantly recognizable, positively sumptuous mix of vanilla bean and rich Madagascar vanilla, now it's also lightened and brightened with juicy, tart citrus. In the heart, the difference becomes even more clear, as licorice-y star anise and fiery cinnamon bring an intense, bright, and subtly masculine edge, while the soft florals of the original Madera still blend with the vanilla to provide smooth creaminess. And in the impossibly rich base, coconut and musk still join the party, keeping us firmly in gourmand territory. So is White Madera still Madera? Absolutely- the cozy, delectable vanilla you know and love is still very much present. But this is a new Madera, with a spicy, sophisticated, grown-up kick- and those seeking some energy with their comfort will not be disappointed."," Vanilla, citrus, peach blossom, floral notes, cinnamon, star anise, tobacco blossom, coconut, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cactus Azul Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," In a garden facing the sea of Uruguay,  a Cactus Flower discovers a corner to feel the soft coat of a sunbeam. Many fragrances are described as ""fresh, "" but that doesn't mean any old fresh scent possesses the kind of invigorating crispness that puts a buzz in your step and a smile on your face. Cactus Azul,  a delightful new offering from Fueguia,  delivers all that and more,  with a uniquely mouthwatering composition that blends floral,  herbal and woody elements for a lighter-than-air fragrance with surprisingly sexy substance. Clean,  heady cactus flowers evoke high-desert romanticism,  while a mouthwatering note of nanah mint (spearmint) shifts our gaze oceanside. Cedarwood,  fresh,  sharp and smooth,  gives backbone and a gently masculine touch. If any old generic fresh fragrance is all you're looking for,  this might not be the scent for you. But if you want a fresh,  vibrant scent that can truly turn heads,  Cactus Azul is an undeniable treasure."," Cactus flower, cedarwood, nanah mint",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chamber Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," Chamber's first perfume was created inspired by the thought of architecture, the analogy. Inspired by architect Louis Kahn's breathtaking, groundbreaking Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Chamber is a scent dedicated to exploring interior space, something it does with an impressively creative array of materials drawn from every level of the natural world, from the bottom of a vast lake to high above our heads. To represent the museum's abundance of concrete, marble, glass, grass and solar light, Chamber employs a fascinating blend of green, fresh, mineralic and spiced notes, notably fondo de lago, a collection of plant life harvested from the lake floor, which combines with tree moss and mate to deliver a sophisticated and unpredictable green scent with compelling depth and an emerging airiness evocative of the steady flow of light across the Kimbell's famed vaulted ceilings. Kahn's genius was to design a museum space that was at once imposing and welcoming, comfortable and beautiful, and as much a work of art as the treasures it would contain. With Chamber, we add yet another treasure to the Kimbell's collection."," Aquatic plants, Spanish moss, Mate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jacaranda Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," The jacaranda blossoms fall behind a misty window. An arpeggio played on a nineteenth-century guitar makes the beautiful silence disappear. From South Africa to Los Angeles, the jacaranda tree stands as an imposingly beautiful symbol of renewal- the brilliant purple blossoms appearing seemingly instantaneously, flooding city blocks with radiant color. These majestic trees are captured in all their gorgeous mystery in Jacaranda, a rich woody fragrance with the import and bearing of an ancient and noble forest. Deep, dark mahogany is interwoven with the freshness of spruce and the almost floral tones of rosewood for a complexity that recalls the exquisite finishes one might find in a master-quality violin, where power and precision combine. Lovers of deep, naturalistic wood scents, Jacaranda is your new obsession."," Rosewood, Mahogany, Spruce",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muskara Phero J Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," An embodiment of the well-kept secret of desire. An elixir that connects the contemporary concept of a fragrance with ancient instincts and ancestry. Soft as skin and thrillingly sensual, Muskara Phero J uses a unique blend of plants from the Amazon region and distilled fragrant molecules to create an olfactory mask, an“anti-perfume” with a possessing ability to interact with the natural smell of the wearer. Ideal for adding a deeply sexy layer of musk to any other scent from the Fueguia collection and beyond, it's also a diabolical secret weapon worn all on its own- a seductive second skin you wouldn't notice until you were firmly in its clutches."," musks ""from the pheromone family""",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62133.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Quilombo Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," In colonial Brazil, Quilombos were synonymous of resistance and independence. Protected by a labyrinth of rivers and impenetrable forests, these fugitive worlds encapsulated an untouched tropical landscape. Mixing together native and African roots, a wild atmosphere emerged full of dances, rhythms and delicious flavours made from cupuacÃº and dulce de leche (a candied concentration made from burnt milk).  This is the scent of Quilombo, a mouthwatering treat that elevates the art of the milky gourmand beyond where we thought it could go. A sweet, creamy, ""how did they do that?""-level realistic hot milk accord wows our noses and tastebuds alike, while careful touches of vanilla and cane sugar supplement without overwhelming, keeping the composition specific and never in the realm of generic dessert scent. Long a symbol of hope, perseverance and joy in the face of oppression, Quilombos occupy an important place in Brazilian history. No matter your own personal battles, we think Quilombo can be a fragrance that offers some small element of these important concepts with each spray."," Vanilla, Pampa Milk, Cane Sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62134.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thays Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," Passionate about native flora, Thays created unique parks. We have imagined the improbable encounters of multiple odors in his enchanting gardens. Originally born in France, Carlos Thays nevertheless was as true an Argentine as lived, with his landscape and park designs forming a significant and lasting element of Buenos Aires and beyond, parks that still have the capacity to enchant and amaze. To represent this in fragrance, Fueguia merges the delicate tones of mate flowers mingling with lush, creamy osmanthus and the vivid freshness of green tea. One sniff, and you're wandering the the Roman gardens of the Jardin Botanico, Thays' mansion ahead of you, lost in the natural splendor and in love with the world."," Mate flowers, Osmanthus, Green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62135.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Cautiva Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," A heavenly musk laced with fruit and vanilla. La Cautiva means“The Captive”,  and it refers to an epic poem by Esteban Echeverria which is considered one of the first great works of modern Argentinian literature. This is an imaginative speculation about the scent of Mary, the main character, and while we have never read the poem, we can state unequivocally that she smelled delicious. This is airy and delectable – an enchanting confection that features a creamy whipped vanilla and a piercingly sweet black currant. The musk is soft spoken and warms to the skin as the edible elements come forward. Initially, there is a hint of syrup to the berries, but the intense sugar eases into a juicy, fresh currant with a hint of minty green leaves. As cloud-light and effortless as a meringue, topped with perfectly ripe berries - this is like a dessert you would eat in a dream.  The perfect warm weather gourmand."," Musk, blackcurrant, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Biblioteca de Babel Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," Cedar shelves, heavy leather bookbindings, vellum leaves, the smell of ink. The complex environment of an old book is brought to life. Named after a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, about an enormous library of interlocking rooms, housing a vast collection of books – this fragrance is about the intoxicating scent of an old library where the books have been kept impeccably dry. It is a combination of warm woods, leather bindings, and a hint of ink. The strongest element here is absolutely the wood – warm, reassuring cedar and a South American wood called cabreuva, which complements the cedar.  This is deep, burnished and luxurious. The first impression is waxy and surprisingly sweet. There is a rich tuberose-like note, like a flower pressed between the pages, and a dusting of cinnamon. Than we get the soft, worn leather of book bindings, the dry spiciness of old vellum and  a trace of tobacco. This is like the warm, comforting embrace of a favorite armchair, in a book-lined room. An instant favorite – we would love to spend a long time in this library."," Cedar, cabreuva (woody note), cinnamon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Panthea Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," How do you picture the scent of heaven? Forget about the specificity of religion, and focus only on the general concept: a pearly-white paradise above the clouds, clean and enveloping, mysterious yet sublimely blissful. This is the scent of Panthea, a fresh, feminine, iris-driven addition to the 777 series imbued with an almost transcendent sense of grace. Pathea opens with an energetic sense of freshness, balancing the gentle juiciness of tangerine against the sparkle of pink pepper with a sweepingly smooth white tea providing a pristine backdrop. The heart of iris has plenty of compelling powdery floral character, but also a softness that eschews rooty or earthy tones in favor of delightfully lush white florals and muskiness. A delicate balance of light woods, tonka and patchouli lend longevity without bulk- the scent is weightless throughout. Spend a day in the clouds with Panthea- we doubt you'll ever want to come back to earth."," Bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wish Come True Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Sweet and shimmering, lush and enveloping, Wish Come True is a mystical potion perfect for any and all who know you're never too old to believe in magic. Crafted around a gorgeous symphony of citrus, florals and vanilla, Stephane Humbert Lucas' latest journey to faraway lands leads not to the palaces and oases of the Middle East, but to Avalon itself, a world of sweet enchantments and illusions that may be more real than our own reality. Wish Come True opens with fresh, bright citrus brushed with sweet ylang and enveloped in powder, like a ray of sunlight through a gentle fog. A supernatural tuberose, both fresh and voluptuous, lies amidst a bed of hypnotic incense and ambergris, with a rich vein of labdanum and vanilla coating every surface, drawing us ever further into the beautiful surrealism.  Enchanting, creative and prosaic, Wish Come True is a new journey into mythical lands- one you won't want to miss."," Tangerine, bergamot, ylang-ylang, labdanum, incense, jasmine, ambergris, tuberose, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
MEM Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Not since AimÃ¨ Guerlain created Jicky in 1889 has a perfumer done something so radical to lavender. Antonio Gardoni takes the sunny herb from its kitchen garden setting and passes it through clay, wood, minerals, burned sugar, and wax so that a new form emerges, like steel forged by the elements. MEM contains all the hallmark Bogue signatures but represents a clear step forward in complexity even from the masterpiece that is Maai.MEM opens up on a dark lavender note that smells less like fresh herbs and more like clay and cepes. Sunshine soon arrives in the form of hops, toasted malt, and the pale ale fizz of aldehydes, lifting the scent out of its humus-rich opening. The scorched-sugar of ethyl maltol caramelizes the lavender, creating a phantom accord of fruit like the dark, almost calcified contents of a forgotten jar of peach marmalade. But as soon as the mind adjusts to this accord, MEM shifts again, this time into a rich floral heart of jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang that sacrifices prettiness for the more interesting facets of wax, gasoline, and rubber. Indian sandalwood with its wheaten milkiness and Himalayan cedarwood with its lingering note of woodsmoke work in tandem to ease the florals and aromatics into the base. The drydown, which is sturdy and beautiful, weaves the sweet dust of unlit incense into the musky, salty, animalic base of a barbershop fougere. MEM is not a perfume that lends itself to easy interpretation, it will reward your patience a hundred times over. In terms of who can wear it, MEM is something of a chimera: sometimes it seems masculine, at others, feminine. Beautiful, quixotic, and memorable, we think this is artisanal perfumery at its most daring."," Petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender (4 different species), ylang ylang, lily of the valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose damascena, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, Siam benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, Himalayan cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66921.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Delma Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Dalma Island lies just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.  It's known for its pearl trade and famous for its pearl divers and legends of buried treasure left behind by ""pearl pirates.""     Widian uses the images and stories of Dalma Island as inspiration for one of its softest, sweetest compositions yet. Leather and marshmallow shape a base that is as delicious as it is fresh. It creates the foundation for Delma's creaminess, which never crosses fully into the gourmand category,  but rather is contrasted by resinous guaiac and fresh green galbanum. The peach-laced floral heart of the composition is balanced by a dusting of saffron and nutmeg. Delma's contrasting notes are masterfully blended into the olfactive equivalent of the smooth, iridescent texture of a pearl.  Shimmering, sweet and irresistible."," Mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Liwa Eau de Parfum,Widian," The Liwa oasis is a lush valley of date palm farms and Bedouin villages in the middle of a seemingly endless sea of sand. Its improbable beauty is the inspiration behind Widian's newest fragrance, a gorgeously modern oriental that perfectly blends stylish florals with exotic spice. Liwa evokes the oasis with lush jasmine, creamy amber, and sandalwood surrounded by dry saffron, wafting smoke and a powdery patchouli and vetiver base. It's a perfectly balanced combination of heady powdery spice and smoke with creamy sweet white florals and ambers. Like its namesake, Liwa is a hidden treasure, waiting to be discovered."," Jasmine, saffron, bergamot, artemisia, amber, white rose, geranium, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70910.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aqaysos Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," What is the scent of crystalline wood? This concept,  of the strange geometry that might exist somewhere between nature's most versatile material and one of it's most fascinatingly exact,  is what inspired Pierre Guillaume to create Aqaysos,  a scent which casts a fascinatingly illusive prism that alternates between spicy,  fruity and woody notes. The result is an elusive,  versatile and sneakily powerful fragrance that wears like a suave,  modern,  and refreshing take on a certain wildly popular fruit-inflected masculine. Which isn't to say Aqaysos is another dull Aventus knockoff. In fact,  quite the opposite- while the juicy,  explosively fresh lime and bergamot opening is sure to delight,  it's cut with an aromatic dose of coriander,  lending a metallic quality to it,  at once mathematically precise and yet intriguingly otherworldly. A unique heart of little-used sansho berry,  with its lemon-peppery spiciness,  adds fiery depth to the sweet,  juicy blackcurrant. And growing ever stronger as it dries,  a robustly woodsy and musky base is given subtly bitter power with a dose of cocoa bean,  which asserts itself in unexpected rhythms. Lovers of fresh,  fruit-and-wood driven masculine scents will surely find a new go-to with Aqaysos. But this fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets all its own.A first for the Huitieme Art collection,  Aqaysos is presented in a unique ""Shadow Flacon, "" with the iconic Parfumerie Generale silhouette blacked out by an interior ceramic coating."," Lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musks, cocoa beans",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Il Tempo delle Mele Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Ask what region has the best food in Italy and you're bound to hear some profound disagreements- after all, we're talking about the gastronomic center of the universe- but we'd be willing to bet that Emilia-Romagna comes up more often than most. The northern region that contains Bologna, Modena, and Parma is certainly a culinary powerhouse, one that Parma native Hilde Soliani has visited in her work before, but with Il Tempo delle Melle, her ode to Emilia-born chef Igles Corelli, Soliani opts for a simple, mouthwatering local delicacy- the torta di mele ferrarrese, a basic but luscious apple cake enjoyed by everyone from kids to grandparents. But as Hilde's to-die-for gourmands have always taught us, simple doesn't have to mean boring, and Il Tempo, with its vibrant, juicy tart apple, creamy vanilla, and warm, mouthwateringly lactic milk note that emerges more and more as the fragrance dries. While we weren't lucky enough to grow up in Emilia-Romagna, this scent nevertheless has a Proustian nostalgia to it, evoking images of warm family gatherings overlooking the Adriatic. Just this once, you're allowed to skip dinner and go straight to dessert."," Milk, apple, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46633.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hot Milk Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," What, exactly, is Hot Milk? One sniff and you'll realize that's not an easy question to answer. Sure, there's an intensely electric burst of resinous black pepper, nose-tingling cinnamon, and even an undercurrent of insidiously scalding chili oil, but leave it to Hilde Soliani to balance all of that firepower on top of a pitch-perfect milk note that soothes the spirit and ignites our sense of childhood with a wondrously cool creaminess. And what do those two opposite elements add up to? It seems like each time we put it on our skin, we pick up yet another facet- sometimes the energetic pepper dominates, other times the smooth gourmand aspects, and often still the two synthesize into something that resembles a rich, fascinating woodsiness. What we do know for sure- this is undeniably a Hilde scent."," Milk, hot pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46634.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carnicure (formerly L'animal sauvage) Eau de Parfum,Marlou," Wow. Carnicure is one naughty little kitty. In case you've been looking for it, Carnicure is the sweet spot between the ferocious dirtiness of Serge Lutens Muscs Kublai Khan, the smutty florals of Kiehl's, and the milky innocence of Helmut Lang EDP. In other words, this one is not only gorgeous, not only elegant, but above all exceedingly sexy.A brief flash of flowers - orange blossom and violet – set the mood for passion, and before we know it we're lying on a massive bed piled high with animal pelts in front of an open fire in an ancient castle. The deep, civety funk of the fur mingles with the smells of desire- salt, sweat, skin, and human fur. But an echo of the sugared flower petals and milky sandalwood still glows through the haze of musk, gently suggestive of the comfort of a lovers' bathing ritual. Innocence lost, and then regained – over and over again. This right here is the smell of human intimacy.Update: Carnicure is a new and improved version of the L'animal sauvage, slightly reworked to deliver a newly focused base that incorporates touches of vanilla, sandalwood, ambergris, and labdanum. It's slightly less fruity than the original, but its deeply sensual spirit is unchanged."," Orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Passion Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," In the throes of true passion, there is no room for hesitation, self-consciousness or restraint- only inspiration. M. Micallef's newest creation is a true representation of that fervor, a vivid sensory rush of juicy fruits, fiery spices and deep, rich woods that combines for a euphoric, luxurious fragrance experience unlike any other. Bold, mouthwatering orange washes over a smooth, caramel-inflected oud with spikes of cinnamon and deep, gourmand patchouli, creating a vibrant and romantic ode to love and artistry. The brilliant, eye-catching gold bottle only increases the compelling sensuality, promising that Passion will be the centrepiece of any collection. Give yourself over to Passion- we're certain you'll come away more than satisfied."," Orange, cinnamon, cashmeran, caramel, benzoin, sandalwood, musk, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahele Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Over the course of the mid-1600s, three intrepid Frenchmen- named Bernier, Tavernier and ThÃ©venot- ventured separately into the heart of Mughal India, seeking fortune, adventure, discovery and opportunity. Their multitude of experiences, from serving in the royal court to trading for the legendary Tavernier (Hope) Diamond, become three individual travelogues, which thrilled and educated audiences back in Europe and informed centuries of European obsession with Eastern art and culture. Rahele (""Traveler""), the newest fragrance from Neela Vermeire, is a gorgeously smooth and breathtakingly rich new floral that honors these travelers with an elegant Euro-style chypre that pulses with Indian spice and exotic floral life. Cardamom and cinnamon inject vibrant energy into smooth, powdery violet and iris, while rich, creamy osmanthus wraps around lush rose to evoke grand baroque fashion with a sensual caress of lusciously soft leather. By bringing their Indian experiences to the French masses, Bernier, Tavernier and ThÃ©venot brought the world closer together. Now, with Rahele, their accomplishments are yet again given vivid new life."," Green mandarin, cardamom, cinnamon, violet leaf, osmanthus, rose, magnolia, jasmin, iris, violet, cedar, sandalwood, oakmoss, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sweet Parmesan Violet Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Life in Hilde Soliani's hometown of Parma, Italy, is possibly as close to paradise on Earth as one can get. The gorgeous, historic streets thrum with vibrant but never crowded pedestrian energy (and the occasional hometown-founded Lamborghini), the culture is relaxed yet saturated with the contributions of some of the world's most renowned artists, composers and designers, and the wine, cheese, and prosciutto are the best in all of the country. To honor this remarkable city, Hilde Soliani created Sweet Parmesan Violet, a delectable confection inspired by her native city's predilection for eating the petals of the native-grown Violetta di Parma with a dusting of sugar as a sweet treat. One whiff, and we are whisked away to the Piazza Garibaldi, marveling at the historic walls of the Palazzo del Governatore and savoring the sugary pop of smooth, powdery violet, feeling the relaxation wash over us. Obviously, the best way to feel the satisfaction of Parmesan life is to buy a one-way ticket and never look back. But Sweet Parmesan Violet is more than enough to hold us over for now."," Violet, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Una Tira l'Altra Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Summertime in Italy means long, languid days of relaxation and banter, lounging in sunshine and watching the world go by. There's wine, of course (always wine), but on the hottest days, real Italians rich for the Luxardo, a rich cherry liqueur with mouthwatering flavour and a surprising bite. Una Tira l'Altra is single-minded in its recreation of this liqueur, resulting in a fragrance that, while straightforward, conceals endless complexity of fruit-drenched flavour. These cherries are sweet and syrupy, juicy and fruity, tart and boozy, revealing different aspects in unexpected combinations as it casually stretches itself off the skin. For a particularly indulgent treat, you can even do as the Italians would and pour it over creamy gelato- or in this case, layer it atop Soliani's mouthwatering Crema di Latte. Our new holy grail cherry is here, and we're positively intoxicated.", Cherry,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46632.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Orange Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," A beautiful rendering of a dark chocolate Mounds bar in perfume form. The opening notes of Oud Orange Intense are smoky and nutty, bringing to mind a pile of coconut husks smoldering in the ashes of a fire. Creamy musks and bourbon vanilla bring a cocoa-tinted softness to the mix, restraining the beachy exuberance of the coconut, and also its sweetness. What emerges is a dry, woody vanilla with a luxuriously boozy touch, like a log of driftwood rubbed lightly with coconut liquor. The oud note here is less of a headlining note than a calming influence on the other notes. Its austere woodiness turns what could have been a full-on, coconutty tropical extravaganza into an adult woody vanilla. Oud Orange Intense is both a surprise and a triumph."," Coconut, fruits, bourbon vanilla, oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Noir Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Unlike the majority of orientals called“intense” or“noir”, Oud Noir Intense actually lives up to its name. Weaving jasmine and roses into a brocade of pure, smoky oud, sandalwood, musk, and spices, the result is an incredibly rich, potent perfume that feels like it should be kept in a ceremonial chamber for anointing the temples and robes of Emirati royals. The fragrance is complex but so expertly blended that each note feels like an extension of the next: spicy florals, creamy musks, animalic oud oil, smoky-sweet resins, and earthy patchouli all swirled together like cream through a cup of black coffee. A dark and mesmerizing fragrance that represents the very pinnacle of oriental and Arabic perfumery."," bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, saffron, patchouli, vanilla, musk, amber, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sahraa Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Despite its desert inspiration, Sahraa Oud is a perfume that is as placidly, richly golden as a piece of Bvlgari costume jewelry. Featuring a large dollop of the real oud oil that Fragrance du Bois sources directly from its plantations in Asia, its soft but feral aroma is cushioned by layers of sweet, orangey amber, sandalwood, and roses – essentially a dab of oud buried deep within the folds of Fendi's Theorema.  Warm, soft, and almost waxy in its roundness, this is a scent that gives off the satiny glow of an aged wine. A touch of inky moss and spicy saffron lends Sahraa Oud a chypre touch, giving the waxy amber a faintly bitter, pleasing bite, like the patina on old wood. Rather than the desert, Sahraa Oud brings us to a backstreet in Tokyo, its velvety darkness lit by strings of glowing red and orange lanterns."," rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
London Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Too good not to share! That's what former World Heavyweight Boxing Champion David Haye, said to Fragrance du Bois when they handed him this originally bespoke fragrance. So they unleashed it on the world, and boy, are we glad. Composed to reflect the exciting mix of cultures and stories of the city Haye loves, London Oud is a true melting pot of a fragrance that pulls together opposing elements that you'd think won't work together but absolutely do. The aromatic freshness of spearmint, lemon, and lavender adds lift and movement to the spicy, dark woodiness of the oud oil, and the whole thing is shot through with sparkling marine notes. An aquatic oud fragrance? An unusual approach but we find this fragrance utterly convincing – it's a great marriage of land (oud) and sea (aquatics) that proves that diversity truly is the spice of life."," lemon, bergamot, mint, lavender, jasmine, white flowers, marine notes, patchouli, cedar, nutmeg, cardamom, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Jaune Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Wow! One hit of Oud Jaune Intense and we are floating in away in a pool of tropical island bliss, our senses lulled by the heady aroma of pikake and gardenia petals soaking in coconut oil. This is one big-bosomed island girl of a perfume and we love it. Juicy pineapple and monoi oil form a fruity, creamy grin that lifts the corners of the scent at both ends. Oud? It's there, but only in homeopathic doses, tethering that big yellow balloon of tropical flowers to a woody, slightly smoky backbone. Ylang and jasmine bring some earthy, spicy gravitas to the pool party, but lascivious orange blossom turns up the heat. It ends, as all great parties should, with a big mug of warm vanilla milk before bed."," Tahitian gardenia, ylang-ylang, pineapple, jasmine, orange blossom, oud, vanilla, lactones, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Bleu Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Oud Bleue Intense does indeed have a strangely“blue” vibe to it. Bracing and intense, its mixture of marine air, earth, truffles, and ozone is simply intoxicating. Opening with an earthy, fungal myrrh fused with oily sandalwood, the scent picks up spice in the form of nutmeg and cardamom but retains that cool tone. A bright mandarin note weaves it way through the resins and spices, keeping things as fresh as a Mediterranean breeze. The citrus, myrrh, and spices continue to dominate well into the heart, where they merge smoothly with a rich, balsamic amber. In what has become a signature of Fragrance du Bois, the pure oud oil in this composition is deployed as a unifying balm to knit all the other elements together rather than to stand out on its own. If you're wary of oud but love fresh, spicy, balsamic ambers, then give this one a try. It's superb."," Cardamom, nutmeg, mandarin, frankincense, labdanum, myrrh oil, amber, pure oud oil, sweet myrrh, styrax, benzoin, myrrh resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Rouge Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," There is something incredibly sexy about Oud Rouge Intense. At first glance, the notes seem minimalistic. But put it on warm skin and it comes alive, the bright, spicy pepper and lemon mingling with the musky cedar and dry, aromatic sandalwood to create a scent that will leave people wondering if you're wearing perfume or if your skin just smells that amazing. Imagine making love in the middle of a forest, your skin, sweat, and hair mingling with the soil, wood dust, and ion-charged air, and that's what this smells like. The woods play off each other in a subtly exciting way: the musky, slight bitter cedar adding muscle, the sandalwood a lactic creaminess, and the pure oud oil a smoky, medicinal depth that feels as old as time itself. Lovers of aromatic, spicy woods – your ship has come in."," Pink pepper, lemon, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

20 Years Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," Twenty years ago, Martine Micallef, Geoffrey Nejman and Jean Claude Astier introduced a brand that would set the high standard for how luxury niche fragrance should look, feel, present and smell. Now, as they celebrate their 20th anniversary, M. Micallef has released a new Les Exclusifs scent inspired by a renewed drive for travel and exploration, a modern gourmand that borrows expertly from M. Micallef's rich history of elegant florals and mouthwatering gourmands, while also incorporating the sophisticated and spicy exoticism that has shown up in their more recent work. The result is a fragrance that sums up the best of what this iconic brand has to offer, while also proving that the wondrous creativity of this team is as fresh as ever.20 Years opens with precious notes of white rose and transparent jasmine, fresh, lush and romantic, which reveal subtly sweet and herbaceous davana and rich, gorgeous orange blossom. Micallef's signature gourmand touch soon sweeps us away on a tide of delectable caramel, faceted with earthy-sweet patchouli and precious woods, buffered with impossibly creamy vanilla. As lusciously beautiful as the scent is the bottle, which adds a new element to the famous Les Exclusifs design with a subtly reptile-inspired outer cover that evokes change and transformation. Warm, sensual, elegant and complex, 20 Years is a celebration of all that M. Micallef has accomplished, and a sign that the next few decades are more promising still."," Bergamot, nutmeg, exotic fruit, white rose, davana, orange flower, jasmine, geranium, patchouli, caramel, vanilla, precious wood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24552.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold I Parfum Extrait,Widian," Powerful, opulent and smooth, Gold I is a new standard of luxury for Widian by AJ Arabia that more than lives up to the prestige of its name. Inspired not only by the lavish oud and amber blend that permeates the composition, but also by the historic journey that these most precious materials once made along the ancient trading routes of Asia, Gold I is a radiant, sensual amber oud both striking and intensely personal. Gold I opens with fresh spiciness, the vibrant zing of pepper balanced with crisp, juicy apple to invigorate and stimulate. A soft, white floral heart quickly adds smooth sensuality, while the powerful oud exudes both romance and impressive strength. A sweet base of musky, woodsy amber only furthers the deep complexity, coaxing you into a dreamlike state that lingers for untold hours. The luxury of Widian by AJ Arabia has been evident in every precious creation the house has ever made, but with the swirling amber richness of Gold I, the bar has been spectacularly raised."," Apple, pepper, white flowers, oud, vanilla, musk, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70905.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Queen Of The Night Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," With unique insight Bertrand Duchaufour has thrown a noose The Selenicereus Grandiflorus, or Queen of the Night, is a rare cactus with a dramatic feature- it blooms but once a year, for a single night, with a fragrance so uniquely beautiful that it has been the stuff of legend for centuries. With this inspiration, Bertrand Duchaufour and Grandiflora have delivered a fragrance that not only captures the devastating beauty of this remarkable plant, but also the poetically fluid nature of its transformation, a captivating mix of memory and desire. Impossible to unravel, the floral bouquet opens fresh, bright and lightly fruity, gaining lushness and vibrancy by the moment before dawn's light sees the florals slowly recede into a gentle base with delicate woodsy and powdery tones. As with the fleeting bloom it so perfectly represents, Queen of the Night is sensual, compelling and evocatively bittersweet- a tale of love without regret."," Citrus, berries, clove, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, ylang ylang, tuberose, gardenia, pittosporum, wisteria, mimosa, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cafe Chantant Parfum Extrait,Nobile 1942," The ""Singing CafÃ©s"" of the Belle Ã‰poque- renowned venues of theatre, song and drink that played a major role in the revitalization of Paris in the late 19th century. Artists, socialites and revelers of every social strata flocked to these magical establishments in droves, cultivating an optimism and cultural explosion of unparalleled energy. With CafÃ© Chantant, Nobile 1942 pays tribute to the unique atmosphere of the Singing CafÃ©, from the elegant chypres worn by fashionable ladies, to the rich tobacco smoke of their gentleman companions, and even the delicacies on the tables and in the cocktail glasses, for a fragrance of rich, creamy, aromatic depth.CafÃ© Chantant opens with a juicy burst of sweet black cherry and mouthwatering spice, immediately enveloping us in a world of heady liquors and exotic delights. A powdery floral heart of heliotrope and iris recalls the exquisite cosmetics and larger than life fragrances of years past, while a base of deeply creamy vanilla and rich, musky patchouli and benzoin swoons with an atmosphere both sultry and gourmand. The overall effect is complex, evocative and dreamlike- a window into an incomparably glamorous past."," Black cherry, laurel, anise, heliotrope, altea, iris, benzoin, vanilla, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52318.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Taklamakan Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Dark and sultry, dry and sweet, Taklamakan ripples like the sands of the desert for which it was named, engulfing you in an addictive cloud of smoky vanilla, luxurious caramel, richly spiced patchouli, and sumptuously balsamic resins under skies heavy with ambergris. Hot, dry desert winds blow from the east, bringing exotic luxuries from the ancient Spice Route, incense and opoponax, and setting ablaze a rich cadre of woods consisting of Chinese cedar, birch, cade, and guaiac. As they slowly envelop the dark vanilla at Taklamakan's heart, dusty myrrh and sweet myrrh cast their magic in a haunting spell that is made all the richer by opulent sandalwood, luxuriously creamy tonka, chewy labdanum, and a drop of dry rose. In its drydown, Taklamakan becomes a comforting dream of golden amber infused with creamy plushness, dry woods, velvety resins, and soft spiciness. Powerful, deep, and long-lasting, Taklamakan entranced us with its sweet desert song, and has become a new favorite from Stephane Humbert Lucas."," Bergamot, rose, patchouli coeur, black vanilla, tonka absolute, birch, cade, gaiac, cedar, myrrh, orris, tolu balsam, labdanum, ambreine, amber gris, benzoin, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"Eye, Hatshepsut Eau de Parfum",Charenton Macerations," Eye, Hatshepsut is an olfactive homage to one of history's most notable gender rebels: Pharaoh Hatshepsut of Egypt. A warrior, a visionary, a pioneer... she is most remembered for her enduring ability to rewrite the narrative of history in her favor: a mythical legacy forever emblazoned into the walls of her temple at Dayr al-Bahri. The structure of the fragrance takes inspiration from the many depictions of Hatshepsut as a female figure in male dress. It juxtaposes softer, sweeping floral arcs of lotus and iris with starker, contrasting resinous edges of kohl and kyphi, blending elements of strength and beauty together against the crystalline backdrop of the Saharan sands."," Papyrus, blue lotus, smoke, burnt tallow, kohl, cinnamon, honeyed wine, orris butter, patchouli, incense, labdanum, Egyptian musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perdizione Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Being lost isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it's liberating to completely let yourself go, to give in utterly to pleasure and let the tides of delight carry you where they will. That's exactly what Nobile 1942 had in mind when they created Perdizione, a lusciously rich tempest of sweet florals whipped up in a compellingly smooth, creamy layer of musks and woods that makes our heads spin and our mouths water. Bright and sensual neroli and sweet ylang blend with elegant jasmine, while a creamy vanilla sweeps in like a monsoon and envelops everything in a blissful haze where down is up and time and space lose meaning. We may not know where we're going once we're lost in Perdizione. But we're in no rush to find out."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lavender, ylang-ylang, rose, orange blossom, neroli petitgrain, cedar, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52317.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sandalo Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," We've always loved Nobile 1942, but the venerable Italian house has been on a particular tear lately, releasing a series of inspired scents that pull off the impressive feat of being as wearable as they are strikingly original. So when we say that Sandalo Nobile is as comfortable and easy to wear as any sandalwood in recent memory, that's not faint praise- spicy yet smooth, robustly textured yet soft-spoken, Sandalo Nobile is a deliciously woodsy treat for the senses. Think of it as a just-stronger-than-skin scent that even the manliest of men could wear with confidence. Sandalo Nobile opens with a rich tapestry of spices, where fiery cumin and mouthwatering saffron open the palate to a buttery iris that seals in the near-gourmand elements just in time for the woods to emerge. And what a blend of woods it is- lightly green fig tree, peppery gurjum, fresh cedar, and the star of the show, a sandalwood both creamy and robust, velvety smooth, and humming with quiet power. Looking for an everyday sandalwood scent that doesn't believe that discretion is the opposite of personality? Nobile 1942 has just what you need."," Saffron, cumin seed, iris, fig wood, gurjum, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
On The Road Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Like the Kerouac original, On The Road is a modern travelogue classic with attitude and style to spare. The story begins with intense, smoky notes of benzoin and birch, reminiscent of the hot asphalt and grittiness of New York City. As we wind across the country, our journey takes us through the openness of the dusty cornfields of a Mid-Western America, punctuated by forays into smoky tobacco filled jazz bars, and eventually rising to the cedar forests of a Pacific Coast. The restlessness of the journey finally gives way to a bright-eyed optimism left by the fresh green fragrance of galbanum, citrus and bergamot. With this dynamic, vibrant followup to She Came To Stay, Timothy Han solidifies his reputation for smart, complex natural perfumery with literary style to spare."," Galbanum, lemon, bergamot, lavandin, amyris, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka bean, oakmoss, gaiac, benzoin, birch, vanilla, labdanum, perou",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black V Parfum Extrait,Widian," Bold yet sophisticated, luscious yet playful, Black V is a snappy, vivacious, and utterly lovely floral-driven parfum extrait that recalls the verve, vigor and creativity of the 1920's. Black V opens with a blast of energy, combining spicy cinnamon with crisp, tart lemon peel and juicy peach. In the sumptuous heart of the fragrance, narcotic tuberose is given a natural vibrancy with lightly bitter orange blossom and a bright solar accord, leading into a rich but never heavy base of warm cedar, smooth vanilla, and a dollop of sweet caramel. All of Widian's wondrous fragrances combine the best of east and west; we're thrilled to report that Black V also includes a tantalizing, joyful mix of past and present."," Lemon, peach, cinnamon, tuberose, orange blossom, solar accord, cedar, caramel, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Incarnata Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," Ravishingly, unapologetically sexy, Incarnata is the fragrance, quite literally, of a goddess incarnate- a supernaturally powerful feminine presence made flesh and blood. Opening with a fiercely vibrant splash of fruit and florals, Incarnata thrums with sensual energy from the very first impression. A lushly feminine heart is dominated by a captivating lipstick note, both immediately identifiable and surprising in its smooth, lightly powdery depth- lovers of Malle's Lipstick Rose can expect to meet their new obsession. A warm base featuring myrrh, amber, and Lebreton's delicate suede note wrap you in a close embrace, completing a seduction that's all but irresistible. For any woman unafraid to make a serious impression, Incarnata is a true force of nature."," Raspberry, violet, rhododendron, lipstick, iris, myrrh, rose, amber, suede, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Haine Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit," A contemporary black and white masterpiece directed by Mathieu Kassovitz's, the film is set in a banlieue (government housing project) outside of Paris. In 24 hours, the movie provides a passage way into the lives of a mixed-race young male trio, consumed with the hatred fueled by police brutality and racial conflict. The fragrance was created to capture specific moments of aggression and tension in the film with smells of a cold blade, polished gun steel and the burning from riots and rubber from drive by shootings. Built around these elements are the scent of concrete and the septic environmental smells that fill the walls of government housing projects."," aldehyde, buchu leaf, bay, birch, cedar, metallic accord, leather, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Madagascan Jasmine Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Inspired by the Stephanotis Floribunda, an asterid treasured above normal star jasmine for its unique aroma and used frequently in high-end bridal bouquets, Madagascan Jasmine is a floral fragrance as unique and captivating as its namesake. A true soliflore, Madagascan Jasmine beautifully captures the complexity of Stephanotis, which far surpasses the amorphous sweetness of lesser jasmines, presenting a floral both lusciously white and deeply green, fresh and yet heady, with a boldness appropriate for both the ingredient and the dynamic florist responsible for the Grandiflora line. Eschewing obvious choices, Madagascan Jasmine does not open with rote citrus notes, choosing instead to delve into the stemmy, green notes that represent the fullness of the Stephanotis plant, leading into the rich petals of the heart notes. A touch of waxiness further represents the skin of the petals, while a barely-there woodsiness fortifies without distracting. The Madagascan Jasmine is a flower of unique sophistication and import. We're pleased to announce that its fragrance is all of that and more.","jasmine, citrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Danza delle Libellule Exceptional Edition Parfum Extrait,Nobile 1942," Since we added La Danza delle Libellule to our store last year, we've been overwhelmed with the response- it turns out a lot of people out there are just as swept away as we are by its gorgeous, whimsically feminine combination of sweet fruits, creamy vanilla and playful spices. In fact, just like many others, we've loved La Danza so much that we find ourselves wanting more. Which is why we're so pleased to announce the Exceptional Edition, a sumptuous Parfum Extrait that captures everything we love about the original Eau de Parfum in a gorgeously rich 35% concentration. Now, the red apple is juicier and sweeter, the cinnamon spicier, the vanilla warmer, creamier and butterier, all with a sillage and longevity that last for countless wondrous hours. When we reviewed the original La Danza, we called it the kind of fragrance that you'd wear just to treat yourself. With the Exceptional Edition, that treat just got all the more delightfully indulgent."," Bergamot, red apple, cedar, cinnamon, musk, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salome Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Close the blinds and send the kids to bed- Salome, the latest sensation from Papillon Artisan Perfumes, is Sexy with a grown-up, capital ""S""-- a swooningly vintage-feeling delight that proves that the golden era of full-bodied perfumery isn't nearly as bygone as the doubters might claim. Built around a strikingly animalic blend of rich, dirty florals and even dirtier animalics, Salome is put together with such deft, classic skill that we'd be praising its refinement- that is, if we weren't busy picking our jaws up off the floor. Just as the biblical Salome had a seven-veiled dance of progressive seduction, so too does Salome seduce in tantalizing layers. At first spray, we're struck with bright, bitter orange blossom and the sweet richness of rose and jasmine, with the indolic sensuality of the florals growing gradually. As the rich heart of animalics begins to growl, suggestiveness turns to an all-out bacchanal, with hyraceum, castoreum and an increasingly indolic jasmine all adding their own elements of dirty, carnal power. As Salome reaches the extended final drydown, smoky leather and deep oakmoss begin to move in slower, more deliberate momentum, still every bit as carnal but now even deeper and more luxuriously vintage-feeling. Vibrant, erotic, classic and devastatingly gorgeous, Salome is another big win from one of the most exciting new houses in niche fragrance."," Jasmine, carnation, bitter red orange, Turkish rose, orange blossom, tobacco, hyraceum, styrax, vanilla, hay, patchouli, bergamot, oakmoss, cumin, birch tar, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black I Parfum Extrait,Widian," The original fragrance from Widian by AJ Arabia, Black I distinguishes itself from the flock of Euro/Oriental hybrids in a key way: while inspired by the grandeur of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and rich with perfectly blended spices, Black I is not an ode to opulence. Yes, it's gorgeous, compelling, and exotic, but where another brand might have opted for overindulgence and complication, Black I is a streamlined delight: a mouthwatering, captivatingly individual concoction of spice, incense and woods that's as comforting and casually easy to wear as the hippest of modern perfumery could hope to produce. Black I opens with a simple, but extremely compelling, blend of cardamom and cinnamon- spicy but not nose wrinkling, with a savory subtlety that positively enchants. A heart of delicate incense and smooth cypress adds sophistication and depth, while the drydown of musky sandal and cedar contributes longevity and a sexy modern backbone. AJ Arabia's philosophy shuns gender categories and style classifications, opting simply to say, ""Wear What You Like."" We can assure you that we like Black I very much."," Cardamom, cinnamon, incense, cypress, sandalwood, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black II Parfum Extrait,Widian," Perhaps the most unabashedly lush of the Widian by AJ Arabia series, Black II is a sweet, creamy, exotic vanilla dream that will make you weak in the knees. Opening fresh and sweet with a rich, juicy mandarin orange paired with mouthwatering, syrupy plum, Black II carries into an elegant, sensual heart of lush rose paired with velvety sandalwood. A base of indulgently rich, creamy vanilla is the real star of the show, however, lavish enough to flirt with gourmand territory, but brought back into the realm of unisex wearability with sexy flanking notes of musk and oakmoss. It's the kind of fragrance that reminds you that there was a time when vanilla was a preciously held commodity, as valuable as gemstones or silks. A vanilla fragrance like this is still every bit that rare and precious."," Plum, Mandarin, Rose, Sandalwood, Musk, Vanilla, Moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black III Parfum Extrait,Widian," Vital and invigorating, but also deep and soulful, Widian's Black III is this architecturally-minded line's meditation on the most complex and compelling structure of all: human memory. Featuring a gorgeously balanced collection of crisp, energetic top notes and then a deeper, warmer heart and base, Black III emphatically achieves its concept by leaving the wearer enveloped in a state of nostalgic bliss. Black III opens with a springlike burst of fresh citrus and a mouthwatering spearmint that feels more compellingly fruity than bracing or chilled. The effect is striking and emotional, opening you to the warmth of the leather and dry wood heart notes, which have the evocative comfort of a sunbeam through a dusty library window. In the drydown, softly creamy sandalwood and a hint of vanilla further the relaxingly atmospheric sensation, without ever fully relinquishing the spark of the opening notes. The cumulative effect is, as AJ Arabia describes it, rejuvenating. Everyone's happy memories are different, but we're pleased to say that Black III is designed for all of them."," Bergamot, spearmint, leather, dry wood, vanilla, moss, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black IV Parfum Extrait,Widian," Soft, spicy, and deeply sensual, Widian's Black IV upends the normal conventions of spicy florals, using a deep, richly sweet fruit opening and a musky vanilla drydown to create a sexy, surprisingly unisex rose scent that has us captivated. Opening with a burst of juicy bergamot, Black IV quickly sweetens with an intoxicating confection of blackcurrant and prune notes, as deliciously dark as they are sugared. The floral heart of exotic, sensuous rose and white florals retains a carnally indolic element, while a smooth, animalic musk and vanilla drydown only further ups the seductive factor. At the same time, woodsy leather notes balance the femininity and add long lasting power. Make no mistake, Black IV is a floral- and an enticingly sexy one at that."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, prune, rose, white flowers, vanilla, musk, leather, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Goddess of Love & Perfume Parfum Extrait,4160 Tuesdays," A tribute to Aphrodite, the goddess of pleasure, beauty, love, and- yes- perfume. For this entry in 4160 Tuesdays' Crimes of Passion project, perfumer Sarah McCartney was inspired by the ravishingly full-bodied fruity chypres of the early 1900s, scents like Paul Poiret's Fruits Defendus and Shocking by Schiaparelli. And Goddess of Love & Perfume lives up the the inspiration, delivering a mouthwateringly complex fruit bouquet with an impressively vintage feeling musky drydown. As McCartney describes, this is the scent of power, lust, and attraction, good enough for Venus herself to bathe in ""before descending to earth to seduce beautiful shepherd boys tending their flocks."" Consider us seduced."," Plum, peach, wild strawberry, blackcurrant, raspberry, grapefruit, yuzu, oakmoss, opoponax, bergamot, patchouli, rose, jasmine, lily of the valley, vanilla, vintage musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau Scandaleuse Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," Because ""leather"" fragrances can span a wide variety of styles and notes, there's room for both creativity and disaster. Luckily, L'Eau Scandaleuse is a triumph: an exuberant, sensual leather shot through with bright fruits, narcotic florals and deeply sexy animalic notes to create one truly intoxicating leather scent. L'Eau Scandaleuse opens juicy and wild, with succulent peach and bergamot and sweet davana. The leather accord here is full-bodied and breathtakingly complex, neither screechy nor overly smoky but nuanced, natural and gently rugged, the lovingly aged leather of treasured heirlooms. Combined with a restrained dose of gorgeous, hypnotic tuberose, the results are achingly lovely. In the drydown, deep animalic notes join the harmony, stimulating the primal sensuality and balancing the florals. Leather scents this masterful are rare achievements for even experienced perfumers. With L'Eau Scandaleuse, Anatole Lebreton is staking his claim to that reputation right out of the gate."," Bergamot, peach, davana, tuberose, ylang ylang, leather, castoreum, cypriol, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Lumiere Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton," It is a uniquely French ability to find the romantic sophistication in almost anything, including the inhospitable climate of Mediterranean garrigue land in drought season- climate that inspired the creation of Bois Lumiere. Like a boiling sun beating down on wild immortelle flowers set amongst the parched, rocky terrain, Bois Lumiere projects a dusty, intensely bright floral and woodsy character, honey sweet but bone dry, a hot desert wind that sings of sun-soaked relaxation and an almost alien beauty. Bois Lumiere opens with the aromatics of desert terrain, wild juniper, clary sage and balsam lending resinous richness without a hint of moisture. Through the dryness, sweet honey emerges alongside brittle but sweet florals- immortelle, carnation and rose that lend their perfume to the desert conditions with a dehydrated herbaceousness. In the base, cedarwood provides a stout backdrop for the sweet brightness, absorbing the warmth with languid comfort. Dry, sweet, rich and unique, Bois Lumiere is a dazzling walk across the surface of the sun."," Corsican juniper, clary sage, mandarin, fir balsam, honey, rose, carnation, immortelle, beeswax, atlas cedar, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maxed Out Parfum Extrait,4160 Tuesdays," Inspired by the crazed youthful misadventures of perfumer Sarah McCartney's friend Maximilian Heusler, Maxed Out is a boozy, swaggering, delicious, illicit journey through the neverending nightlife of New York City. As McCartney puts it, ""The kind of night out in New York you don't remember..."" Don't worry, though- you don't have to have (or admit to) firsthand knowledge of that kind of experience to enjoy Maxed Out, which is as mouthwatering as it is intoxicating, as delightful as it is delirious. The coffee, vanilla and rum, in particular, leap off the skin, taking advantage of the extrait strength to blend into a delectable accord that walks the line between gourmand and narcotic and lasts all the way until the sun is rising over Queens and the bartenders are shouting for last call. Spend a night with Maxed Out. Who knows where you'll end up?"," Rum, coconut and lime, tobacco, coffee, cannabis essential oil, vintage musks, vanilla, cumin, Atlas cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64617.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Alchemico Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," The Mazzolari line has always embraced duality: a century of history but a newcomer to the niche fragrance scene, classic influences but modern compositions, Italian style and global influence. Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. Alchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense's rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back aloft, adding a lightly sweet undertone that floats the floral woodsiness to the surface yet again. As with any bout of alchemy, choosing the ingredients is only the beginning. It's the blend where the magic gets made."," Rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Fresh, vibrant and masculine, the fougere style is meant to stimulate the spirit and empower the wearer. With its bright, effervescent timelessness and rich aromatic soul, Fougere Nobile is a sparkling evocation of ocean breezes and rugged, wild coastline, a classically nostalgic fougere that transcends reductive simplicity with an earthy, richly resinous base. Opening with a crisp sparkle of bergamot, Fougere Nobile instantly invigorates with a complex aromatic blend including basil, lavender, and spicy black pepper. Resinous elemi adds an unexpectedly smoky, cool incense vibe, which is reinforced with light, spicy tobacco and earthy vetiver and patchouli. For any gentleman with an eye towards tradition but both feet firmly planted in the modern, Fougere Nobile is a fragrance of great distinction."," Bergamot, basil absolute, lavender, black pepper, elemi, geranium, aldehydes, tobacco, vetiver, tonka bean, patchouli, sandalwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52313.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mortal Skin Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Inspired by the deadly grace of the viper so exquisitely represented on the bottle, Mortal Skin is a meditation on danger, passion and hypnotic obsession that straddles eastern and western perfumery as only Stephane Humbert Lucas can do. Mortal Skin opens with tantalizing mystery, as a cooling, otherworldly ink accord meets sweet, sticky blackberry and resinous rockrose, at once captivating and threatening, familiar and alien. In the heart, the snake rears back to strike, warm opoponax and myrrh washing over us along aromatic and sweet florals and wisps of spice, hypnotizing in their sway. And once we've realized the power contained within, the resinous base of labdanum, styrax and birch, it's far too late to escape- Mortal Skin has us completely in its grip. Beguiling and seductive, this is a fragrance not to be missed."," Blackberry, Ink, Rockrose, Opoponax, Iris, Davana, Myrrh, Cardamom, Ambergris, Storax, Sandalwood, Labdanum, Civet, Atlas Cedarwood, Birch, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Spirituelle Eau de Cologne,Divine," Gorgeously musky, lusciously floral, timelessly elegant. Spirituelle is modern and classic at once, a soft, full-bodied bouquet of roses with an invigorating peppery opening and a sexy, warm drydown that makes us weak in the knees. Spirituelle showcases the type of versatility we've grown to love from Divine- sophisticated and composed enough to wear with a ballgown, gorgeous and fresh enough to turn heads in a t-shirt and jeans. You've smelled rose and musk together before, but you've never smelled it like this."," Pink pepper, sichaun pepper, geranium, labdanum, rose, cedar, amber, musk, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Amber perfume oil,Michele Bergman," A luminous veil of exceptionally creamy amber. Warm and embracing – this enchanting oil is for those who are enamored of amber's sweet side, rather than its mysterious or powdery aspects.  A touch of vanilla and amber melt into each other like long lost lovers – and far be it from us to ever separate them again when they are so obviously made for each other. Luscious and inviting, wearing this fragrance makes us feel like we have a cozy, golden aura around us, protecting us from anything that would make us cold or cranky. If we could, we  would purr."," Tunisian amber, vanilla, hint of patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
She Came to Stay Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by the Simone de Beauvoir existentialist novel, Timothy Han's debut fragrance is a disarmingly complex all-natural chypre with a uniquely balanced spicy herbal character that evolves differently with each application. Like the novel's characters, who find their relationships and sense of self forced into great transition by the events of the world around them, this captivating scent seems nearly impossible to pin down, echoing the passion and creative energy that lifts itself above the austerity and oppression of a Paris on the verge of cataclysmic change.She Came To Stay opens with fresh, sexy aromatic top notes of geranium, lemon and basil giving way to a richly spiced heart featuring Indonesian clove and nutmeg. In a stunning and perpetually changing drydown, deep woody notes of labdanum, patchouli and oakmoss ebb and flow with a more ephemeral forest of cedarwood and vetiver, again supplemented by the crisp lemon and basil of the opening. Both classic and modern, fresh and warm, aromatic and earthy, inspiring us, in that grandly existential tradition, to relinquish our illusions of control and simply allow the power of the fragrance to go where it may.Each package will feature one of five limited edition prints created by award winning visual artist Kirtland Ash."," Geranium, basil, lemon, Indonesian clove, nutmeg, patchouli, vetiver, labdanum, oakmoss, cedarwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme de Coeur Eau de Parfum,Divine," A bracing and peppery opening of juniper, angelica and cypress clears the way for the noble and soulful iris which is very much the heart of this elegant, masculine scent. Vetiver, amber and wild vanilla bring a deep, dusky woodiness that rounds out the fragrance without ever making it heavy. Fresh and subtle, but with a commanding presence. Perfect for the strong, silent type."," angelica, juniper berries, cypress, iris, vetiver, ambergris, wild vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme Sage Eau de Parfum,Divine," An incredible blend of spice, fruit, wood and incense that leaves us weak in the knees. The sage in the name refers not to the herb, but to wisdom. However, if we met anyone, man or woman, who smelled this good, their IQ would be the last thing on our minds.   A spicy opening of saffron, lychee, mandarin and cardamom entices us down a mysterious path where we discover woods amber, patchouli, immortelle and incense, all layering so beautifully that we can't tell where one ends and another begins. All we can do is revel in the enveloping, woodsy, earthy warmth. Serene and hypnotic, this is a scent that seduces quietly, but oh-so effectively."," saffron, mandarin, cardamom, lychee, aromatic woods, immortelle (or everlasting flower), patchouli, oak moss, amber, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Etre Aime - Homme Eau de Parfum,Divine," Yvon Mouchel, dedicated the 7th addition to the world of Divine to a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Linked to its feminine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme (The Beloved Man) also shares with it the main note, the everlasting flower. Focusing on the aromatic aspect of the plant, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme is a woody, boldly spiced scent the masculinity of which is not aggressive but unmistakable. The lively blend of lavender and bergamot gets an extra zing from ginger and a hint of greenness from basil. The piquant accord in the heart of the fragrance mixes helicrysium with cardamom. Amber, exotic woods, patchouli and vetiver provide a rich, dark background for the composition and lend the base a luxurious, classic feel. Masculine perfumery at its finest!"," bergamot, lavender, ginger, basil, cardamom, everlasting flower, cistus, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Augusto Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," The legacy of the Mazzolari line dates back to the original Augusto Mazzolari, a late-1800's Milan barber renowned for the fresh, bright fragrances he would whip up on the spot for his customers. It continued through his grandson, also named Augusto, who took the family fragrance business and expanded it beyond the barbershop and out to the world. Now, Mazzolari honors both family and history with Augusto, a fresh, invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate for a gentleman of any era. Augusto opens with a tart, sparkling dose of bergamot and orange, made cool and refreshing with a spike of mint. A heart of rosewood maintains a sense of clean refinement, with geranium and lavender adding a smooth, masculine complexity. In the dry down, the depth and refinement of ambergris and sandalwood reinforce a sense of classic, understated sophistication. Equally perfect in any situation from the barbershop to the boardroom to the ballroom, Augusto is a testament to the storied history of one of our favorite houses."," Bergamot, sweet orange, mint, rosewood, geranium, lavender, vetiver, amber, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32820.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Rose Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," Like the perfect cocktail, the perfect dress, or the perfect sunset, a perfect rose perfume need not be loud, or flashy, or bogged down by excess detail. Instead, it needs only to be pure, delicate, and true to the subtleties of the queen of all flowers. Le Rose is all of these things, a breathtakingly elegant, beautifully understated rose par excellence meant for the woman who never chases trends but instead is in complete control of her own personal style. Le Rose, as you might imagine, opens with a sole focus on rose, and this one is lusciously delicate: fresh, lightly green, natural, and rich without ever seeming overpowering. Indian sandalwood enhances the rose's woodsier and creamier aspects, while a base of sheer white musk projects a lighter-than-air sexiness that lingers for hours. Le Rose is too straightforward to have a whole bunch of tricks up its sleeve- but this beautifully simple floral proves that one perfect trick is often all you need."," Rose, Indian sandalwood, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32821.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pichola Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Lake Pichola is the crown jewel and central focus of the princely city of Udaipur. A myriad of colourful historic, architectural and spiritual reflections reflect from the surface of this ancient yet manmade treasure - the sunlight and moonlight of each season bringing out the eternal and timeless beauty of the lake and the Rajasthan regionPichola, the latest fragrance from Neela Vermeire Creations, captures this beauty and era-spanning elegance in a symphony of fresh, vibrant orange blossom, tender tuberose, sweet ylang, and tart, crisp mandarin. A princely spice blend- redolent saffron, dry cinnamon, cardamom- dance atop the citrus and flower, while a resinous woody base, sandalwood and vetiver, add a touch of deeper contrast without ever weighing down the exuberance of this magical concoction.Like the reflections over the lake surface, constantly shifting but always reflecting the same colorful, diverse and impossibly rich city next to which it rests, Pichola is a fragrance of luxurious depth, gorgeous light, and immense character. Another triumph from Neela Vermeire."," Cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, juniper, magnolia, neroli oil, clementine, bergamot, orange blossom absolute, rose absolute, tuberose absolute, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, benzoin absolute, sandalwood, driftwood, vetiver from Haiti.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
O/E Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Like any great architect, Antonio Gardoni is obsessed with structure and balance, and the concept that any fragrance, no matter how big and complex, can stand on the head of a pin if the engineering is sound. So it should come as no surprise that O/E, Bogue Profumo's followup to last year's sensational Maai and Cologne Reloaded, is, like its predecessors, a paradox- an elaborately structured, hugely complicated edifice of bright, shining citruses, naturally green spices and florals, warm natural wood notes and sheer synthetic ones, and an underpinning of smoky animalic notes- all of which somehow lock together to form something bright, surprisingly light, and cheerfully uncategorizable.  The combinations are exquisite- an ultra-fresh bergamot opening stands atop a spicy, fresh herb garden of rosemary and thyme. Balsamic camphor cools off a bough of juniper, pine and cypress. A lilt of lush florals offset a benzoin-tinged resinousness, and a transluscent layer of iso-E super wraps it all together and marks the composition as unmistakably 21st century. Each bold stroke is effortlessly complimented with the kind of artistic and architectural virtuosity that balances, but never overlaps, leaving the finished product as impressive in its scope as it is wonderfully enjoyable. Halfway between acoustic and electric, digital and analogue, artisanal and industrial, indoors and outdoors, O/E is another triumph from a truly contemporary talent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, Lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Sticker Set,Charenton Macerations," Limited Edition Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Stickers.Asphalt Rainbow draws inspiration from the ""break the rules"" attitude of global street art: a creative world movement that teaches anything can be a canvas and anyone an artist. Specifically exploring the concepts of distortion, reappropriation, and impermanence, Asphalt Rainbow borrows from a series of masterful street art techniques to craft an olfactive love letter to the street: a roughed up rose that's been hyper-colored, torn apart and twisted on its head, then nailed to the wall for your sniffing pleasure. The arc of the fragrance mirrors the unpredictable lifecycle of street art: a re-envisioned rose accord that distorts and morphs over time like a fragmented floral collage stretched across urban walls and alleyways; its aerosol-tinged aroma ever-fading closer to background."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Spray Paint (Aerosols), Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Detritus, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Asphalt Rainbow Eau de Parfum,Charenton Macerations," Asphalt Rainbow, a tribute to the creativity, spontaneity and political bravery of modern urban street art, succeeds in much the same way that its predecessor Christopher Street did: it's a high-concept, passionate, literate fragrance that, at the end of the day, smells both unique and just plain good. Drawing on the concepts of distortion, reappropriation and impermanence that inform street artists from Blek le Rat to Retna, Asphalt Rainbow takes a universally known perfume note- the rose- and puts it through an impressive bag of artists' tricks, presenting a rose that seems both unnaturally vivid but also surprisingly well-structured, as if stenciled with day-glo spraypaint. A distinct aerosol note lingers above it, and quickly a whole modern cityscape follows- damp pavement, auto exhaust, street food, brick walls, and the fleeting scents of a million strangers brushing past one another in a hurry to anywhere but where they are at this exact moment. That rose brings us back for sniff after sniff, daring us to separate it from the city on whose back it lives, until we realize that we can't- that the city and the flower are one and the same, faded into one another. Fresh, captivating, distinctly modern and urban, Asphalt Rainbow is not only a worthy follow-up to Christopher Street, but also confirmation that Charenton Macerations is a house of true skill and vision."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cristallo di Rocca Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," Rock crystal (also known as quartz) has long captured human imagination not in spite of its unadulterated beauty, but because of it: as one of the earliest forms of jewelry, its striking clarity and natural facets made it a prized accessory long before modern gemstone cutting and polishing methods came into vogue. Cristallo di Rocca pays tribute to this treasured material in full, with a clear, beautifully balanced scent that weaves fresh, clean floral beauty in with a striking mineralic spice blend for an olfactory experience that truly mirrors the intended subject. Like noticing a strikingly clear stone for the first time, Cristallo di Roca opens fresh, bright and clean, with a crisp citrus and delicate floral blend. The gently spicy heart, made up of clove, iris and intriguingly sweet notes of rum and almond, feel wonderfully tactile, as if the edges of the crystal haven't yet been polished into complete conformity, but sparkle nonetheless. A soft base of sandalwood and creamy vanilla is like the exquisite but understated setting, providing sophisticated contrast. Like your fragrance, your jewelry of choice makes a statement about your character. Cristallo di Rocca identifies the wearer, on both counts, as someone for whom individuality coexists perfectly with elegance."," Almond, citrus, lily of the valley, rose, geranium, ylang ylang, cloves, rum, iris, sandalwood, vanilla, and rock crystal.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Morning Muscs Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," There's more than one path to irresistible, and Morning Muscs, with its light, energetic blend of juicy fruit notes married to premium rose and violet, achieves its sexiness precisely because it's just so comfortable in its own skin. Perfect for every woman confident enough in her sexiness to be as ""girly"" as she wants to be, Morning Muscs is an addictive, can't-stop-sniffing-it delight. Opening with rich, juicy peach and sweet toffee that leads into a sumptuous mix of Russian and Turkish roses and sweet violet, Morning Muscs whisks us through a sunrise of delights before ultimately seducing with a mossy, musky drydown. Because anyone who says fun and sexy don't go together really isn't someone we want to have anything to do with, anyway."," Mandarin orange, grapefruit, peach, iris, damask rose, violet, patchouli, musk and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Muscs Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," While plenty of fragrances use ""Black"" in the title to convey intense woods, or fierce, challenging animalics, Black Muscs, with its subtly sensational blend of citrus, lightly floral muskiness, and resonant amber, is far more aligned to the elegant universality of the color- more like a finely tailored tuxedo than a horror movie monster. Opening with a fresh bergamot and lemon blend, transitioning with a lovely rose and patchouli heart, and ultimately settling into a deep, confident amber-and-musk drydown pitched at just the right volume, Black Muscs is a perfect scent for anyone that carries themselves with dignity, but never lets it lapse into self-seriousness. Luxury needn't be pompous, but as Black Muscs proves, it should always be luxurious."," Bergamot, lemon, violet, rose, patchouli, amber, and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Oud Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," One of perfumery's most classic combinations is made new again with this sparkling, spicy oriental stunner. Opening with a burst of deliciously candied fruits, Rose Oud quickly transitions into full seduction mode with a deep, luscious rose note set against a rich, musky oud and white woods accord accompanied with rare saffron and a sweet note of patchouli. A base of deep vanilla and ambery musks maintains a sensual complexity for untold hours. Deep, complex and utterly swoon-worthy."," Rose, agarwood, musk, amber, lemon, olibanum and sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Silver Ombre Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J," The seductive mystery of the orient in a ravishing fragrance for women and men alike. Silver Ombre does indeed feature amber, a lusciously warm and delectable amber, in fact, but to get there, one must first wander through a beautifully appointed marketplace teeming with exotic treasures. Fresh fruits, apple, raspberry and crisp citrus, excite and energize, followed by cart after cart of immaculate flowers, rose and iris, plucked at the exact height of their fragrant powers. Savory saffron and rich vanilla waft in from the spice stands, and exotic woods and patchouli lend power. Finally, we make our way to the amber, and it's all we hoped for, rich, lightly powdery, sweet and deep. Amber lovers of all persuasions- don't miss this one."," Raspberry, lemon, apple, rose, iris, saffron, musk, patchouli, amber, vanilla and white woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's Vaniglia presents all the charm and the enveloping warmth of a cozy vanilla scent.  Creamy caramel and the seductive fragrance of delicate exotic orchids produce a decadent marshmallow quality - the best marshmallow you've ever tasted. The exquisite floral notes of orchid are subtle, but they beautifully enhance the femininity of the fragrance, taking it to a softer, more refined place. Not too sugary or sweet, just a perfect taste of sweetness from Mazzolari."," Vanilla, caramel, orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Christopher Street Eau de Parfum,Charenton Macerations," Home to merchants and misfits, Beatniks and Bohemians, dissidents and protesters, New York City's Christopher Street has established a reputation for celebrating rugged and rebellious individualism. Like the unique architecture of the street's triangular-shaped Northern Dispensary, Christopher Street introduces a distinctive fragrance structure that challenges traditional olfactive notions of gender. Unlike unisex fragrances that target a lowest common denominator (i.e. choosing the least offensive, neutered ingredients for formulation), Christopher Street revels in the unexpected harmonies of its strong masculine and feminine notes. The fragrance combines classical floral chypre elements with more subversive tones of metals, smoky tobacco, watered down alcohol, wet woods and clove."," Alcoholic lime, bergamot, bitter orange, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove bud, orange blossom, poet carnation, incense, moss, musk, myrrh, patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rudis Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," In ancient Rome, the“rudis” was the wooden practice sword of a gladiator, worn into the arena as a symbol of his strength and valor. With Rudis, Nobile 1942 brings us a full portrait of one such ancient warrior, garbed in hardened leather armor, his sword adorned with flowers for courage and luck, fortified with wine and spirits for the battle that awaits. Rudis opens with an opulent blend of whiskey and leather, infused with tart fruits, smoky wood, buttery saffron, and the golden sweetness of immortelle. The leather feels as supple as expensive calfskin, but its luxuriousness has a sensual side from the musk and ambered warmth. A streak of red wine runs through the base, alongside roses redolent with patchouli and spice, balancing the raw masculinity of the opening notes and making Rudis feel both unisex and surprisingly modern. Sweet and spicy, golden and creamy, smoky and earthy, Rudis is an utterly intoxicating stitch in time connecting Europe's past, present, and future in an undeniably captivating fragrance."," bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk and incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52312.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gardenia Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," GARDENIA is part of the Exclusif collection which bottles are hand-decorated with Swarovski crystals.

A delicious fragrance for romantic ladies."," Gardenia, peach, ylang-ylang, jasmine, sandalwood, ambergris, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24547.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohur Extrait Parfum Extrait,Neela Vermeire Creations," Mohur Extrait is based on the Mohur EDP fragrance but has a much higher concentration of perfume.  The perfume has been left to macerate far longer to transfer even more of the absolute to fragrance and allow the full range of notes to blossom. The complexity of the fragrance has increased considerably, intertwining wood, leather, spices, Oudh and the blooming rose in an intoxicating blend offering the ultimate olfactory experience to the perfume wearer.  To be used in moderation, like all finer things in life.Mohur Extrait is a numbered, limited-edition, one time offering."," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot seeds, pepper, elemi, iris, jasmine, rose, violet, almond, leather, sandalwood, amber, woody notes, patchouli, agarwood (oud), benzoin, vanilla, and tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maai Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo," Maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. It opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. The plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before IFRA/EU regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. Musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary Kouros or Muscs Koublai Khan. As Maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. At the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. In its drydown, Maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.We found Maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. A symphonic masterpiece in the vein of Jubilation 25 and Kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. Black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. Maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. Yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. Maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur."," tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SHE Shihan Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," If Piotr Czarnecki's instant cult hit Shihan (formerly called Sensei) was an ode to the perfumer's roots as a professional ballroom dancer- sensual, balanced, and unexpectedly muscular- then SHE Shihan could rightfully be thought of as an even more elegant, unabashedly feminine ballet. Building from the original's unisex oriental gourmand notes of tobacco, whiskey, vanilla and spices, SHE Shihan glides confidently into the world of women's scent, adding a sweet, fresh garden rose to the still beguilingly spiced opening. In the heart of the fragrance, the original's myrrh and frankincense are rounded out with an exquisite, slightly chocolately plum and floral notes of violet and rose petal. While the drydown still features a sweet, shimmering labdanum and ambrette base, the addition of extra vanilla keeps SHE Shihan carefully walking the line between classically rich and surprisingly sexy.No matter what aspect of this gracefully sweet, gorgeously captivating fragrance appeals the most, we're positive that Piotr Czarnecki has yet again stolen our hearts."," Plum, violet, rose, tobacco, incense, spices, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mood Indigo Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit," For Mood Indigo, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Michel Gondry's film, ""L'ecume des Jours"" (Mood Indigo):""For me the film L'Ã‰CUME DES JOURS as a whole was carried by Jazz music; I like this ambiance. The flowers play a strong role (water lily) the film which starts gay and luminous turns and becomes very dark!

For Love Exposure, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Sion Sono's film by the same name:""I was inspired by the films mixture of love, lust, violence, sex and religion.

Discover Anubis, if you dare.""Anubis began life as a signature scent for myself. I have always been drawn to dark, leathery scents and the metamorphosis of Anubis from personal sketch to final product has been considerable. It was nameless until it was completed and it was then that I realised my obsession with ancient Egypt had subconsciously manifested itself; the initial materials used, synonymous with mummification, have now been sweetened into a dark but delicious fragrance. After many reincarnations, Anubis was born."" - Liz Moores, perfumer"," Suede, jasmine, pink lotus, immortelle, olibanum, myrrh and saffron.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A stunningly different interpretation of the majestic rose.""Anthropomorphised throughout literature and poetry the illustrious rose is immortally bound to its sweet, old fashioned and pretty stereotype. Tobacco Rose combines the scent of overblown roses with rich, mineral notes, as though one were breathing in not only the fading petals but the rich earth from which a rose grows. This is a perfume that rejects prettiness but instead combines the opposing masculine and feminine elements that fuse within nature."" - Liz Moores, perfumer"," Bulgarian rose, rose de mai, oakmoss, ambergris, beeswax and peru balsam.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cascades of French mimosa, osmanthus and white champac are woven between the powdered, violet facets of precious orris. Virginian cedarwood and subtle notes of frankincense bring an ethereal light and delicate freshness to this tender composition.""Inspiration for my perfumes comes to me in many ways, but none more so than from the nature in my own garden. Angelique began as an olfactory portrait of the Iris Pallida; days spent breathing in the delicate scent of the flowers and the honeyed aroma of pollen emerged as nature's own sketch of what Angelique would become. Angelique became a perfume based on my personal impression of the beautiful Iris Pallida, a flower that is as captivating and angelic as nature herself.""- Liz Moores, perfumer"," Mimosa petals, orris, champaca, osmanthus, cedar and olibanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2022 Generation Homme Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," 2022 represents an important year for the future of the Middle East: as Qatar will play host to the World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon a great gathering in the heart of the region, an event that, at best, has the potential to demonstrate true sharing among more developed nations and states that are still struggling. Against this backdrop, Stephane Humbert Lucas presents 2022 Generation Man, a fragrance that employs a unique blend of timeless opulence and sleek modernity to represent the distinct character of today's sophisticated Middle Eastern man.2022 Generation Man opens with an unexpectedly bright burst of juicy blackcurrant and zesty yuzu, kept cool with a spritz of fresh mint. It's a wonderful twist for those expecting a by-the-numbers oud and spices, establishing a portrait of a modern young Middle Easterner prepared to greet the global community with as much style and warmth as imposing sophistication. The oud, of course, is present; a fabulously rich heart made from prized Cambodian agarwood of such rare distinction that it can hardly be compared to the synthetically sharp or pungently sour ouds of lesser brands. This is an oud that asserts its own value, dry and distinguished, powerful and almost translucent, connecting the fragrance to an unbroken line of tradition without ever dragging the composition backwards. As a base of rich spices and warm balsamic musk swell in support, the timeless luxury of Middle Eastern perfumery blends seamlessly with modern creativity for a sexy, sophisticated scent any man could wear with confidence.  Presented in a beautiful black lacquered bottle with a handcrafted gold cap, 2022 Generation Man is more than just a striking fragrance; it's a masterful statement."," Yuzu zest, blackcurrant, mint, Cambodian oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shihan Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," A personal labor of love, Shihan is Piotr Czarnecki's tribute to the natural connection between fragrance and dance. As a professional ballroom dancer and dance instructor in his native Poland, Czarnecki had long employed a lifetime obsession with scentmaking to compose fragrances meant to accompany his routines and those of his students, to, in his words,“create their own atmosphere.” But while it may have been originally created for a select few students, Shihan, a warm, exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand, is simply too good to keep secret.  As with a finely crafted dance program, his fragrance (formerly called Sensei) weaves around its central composition with graceful fluidity, revealing wondrous new aspects with each passing moment. The foundation of exceptionally high quality, largely natural ingredients: in the opening, Cuban tobacco and bitter Arabic coffee lend earthy depth to a boozy warm whiskey accord, while colonial spices enliven a mysterious heart of frankincense and myrrh, evoking visions of grand, exotic opulence. A musky amber base purrs with carefully extracted labdanum and sweet ambrette, dreamily resinous.A perfect blend of lively spice and warm richness that will delight fans of gourmands and orientals alike."," Whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Gemstone Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A fragrance named for the sacred cornerstone of the very center of the Grand Mosque of Mecca demands a refinement and respect for both subject and composition. But StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is no mere tourist, and Black Gemstone, through its captivatingly complex blend of myrrh, lemon and smoky incense, indeed inspires a profound respect bordering on wonderment. The Black Stone of Mecca is purported to have fallen directly from Heaven, and the ingredients of Black Gemstone are clearly intended to come as close to otherworldly as possible. Pristinely tart Italian lemon, rich Olibanum-derived incense and three hand-selected types of cedar are but a few of the treasured components, but the true centerpiece is an extraordinary myrrh, painstakingly distilled down into a resinous tar that, like the Black Stone itself, projects a presence that far exceeds its size. And like a true religious experience, Black Gemstone follows no linear path- from moment to the moment, the tartness of the lemon, smokiness of the incense and balsamic sweetness of the myrrh dance around one another with an unpredictability that promises to make each individual encounter profoundly unique.Presented in an elegantly understated black lacquered bottle, with a unique hand-milled black honeycomb top and a small faceted black Swarovski crystal."," Infusion of three cedars lemon, myrrh, tar, incense, teak, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oumma Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas describes Oumma as a study of the contrasts of agarwood (oud), a substance he views with mystical reverence. A single sniff of Oumma can more than explain why: based around the finest Burmese oud and buttressed by Moroccan Rose, Egyptian jasmine and Peruvian Balsam, this fragrance is drawn from the rarest sources on the planet and yet, it hardly feels earthly at all. Instead, Oumma seems to rise from the ground, stretching out each extraordinary facet of its central ingredient until the smoky, spicy wood and subtly sharp, medicinal aphrodisiac properties that make up the duality of oud seem to exist simultaneously, suspended in mid-air. Simply put, Oumma is a fragrance that makes you look to the heavens.A dry, spicy rose and elegantly savory saffron hover beneath, but this is nothing like the lavish-yet-rote oud-rose pairings widely available elsewhere. Rather, these exceptional ingredients, each deserving of a starring role in a different composition, combine with smoke-saturated cade ash to build the earthly pyre from which this singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher.Even the bottle itself seems prepared to leave the ground: shiny and silver, as bright and reflective as the mid-day sky, finished with a polished silver cap and a Swarovski“diamond” placed on the crown. We've never experienced an oud quite like this."," Egyptian jasmine, Moroccan rose, Peruvian balsam, balsam tolu, ashes of cade, Burmese oud, nagarmotha.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose de Petra Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Petra: capital of the Nabataeans, a wonder of ancient engineering, an ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely into the side of the mountain thought to be the biblical Sinai itself. Words cannot hope to describe the majesty of the place known as the Rose City, but StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose a far more appropriate medium with Rose de Petra, a breathtaking floral that honors both halves of its namesake with a rose equal parts refreshingly natural and sumptuously mysterious. We like to think of Rose de Petra as a journey down an ancient stone canyon, with wild roses in full bloom springing from every crack in the rock. What begins as a simple, beautiful journey opens itself to mystery and wonder- that clean, bright rose we smell is no single, simple note but rather an intense rose oxide given body and mouthwatering juiciness from pomegranate and litchi. As the heart of pure, natural Bulgarian rose expands, so too do the spices- cardamom, cumin and pepper, intense enough to invigorate but light enough to place this scent a world away from a typical rose chypre. Here, yet again, we see the necessity of Lucas' uncompromising commitment to top quality ingredients, as Rose de Petra's deceptively simple formula belies an astounding integrity we would not have thought possible from reading the notes alone. Like a fully irrigated city carved into a mountain in the middle of the desert, Rose de Petra is a masterpiece of construction that will knock you over with its beauty.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal placed on the crown."," Rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soleil de Jeddah Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, the Bride of the Red Sea, gateway to Mecca and Medina. To honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of Russian leather, Madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. Like the multi-faceted city of Jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. The initial brightness of Soleil de Jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft Roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. In fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that Soleil de Jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. Once the Russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. Like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the Jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results."," Lemon, Roman chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, Russian leather, vanilla from Madagascar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Khol de Bahrein Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," KhÃ´l: one of the world's earliest cosmetics and the essence of ancient beauty. Think Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra, immaculate jet-black lines of khÃ´l framing piercing violet eyes, infusing what was already stunning with near-mystical seductive power. KhÃ´l de Bahrein is a tribute to the elegance and ingenuity of the ancient world, where the untold balsamic depths of a sumptuous amber-benzene heart frame a strikingly lovely violet and iris led floral with masterful precision. KhÃ´l de Bahrein opens with complimentary waves of deep, resinous amber and an iris both richly earthy and subtly sweet. As the iris evolves to an almost candied sweetness, the violet and ambergris weave seamlessly in, lending a powdery softness that anchors without ever diluting. It is an exquisite balancing act achievable only with the finest natural iris and ambergris, highest-quality ingredients that also result in a projection and longevity impossible with mundane synthetics.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal, KhÃ´l de Bahrein is that rarest of treasures: a celebration of timeless beauty that proves itself equally beautiful, inside and out."," Violet, nougat, gums, iris powder, sandalwood, benzoin, amber, musky balsamic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
O Hira Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," To say that O Hira is perhaps the finest amber fragrance in the world isn't so much a matter of opinion as it is a matter of pedigree. 777 creator and nose StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas became fixated on creating an amber scent that would spare no expense, cut no corner, in pursuit of the most precious ingredients on the globe. The process would end up taking him 2 years of dedicated work, but the result is nothing short of extraordinary: O Hira, the powerful, authentic scent of fossilized amber, a masterwork that Lucas considers“the diamond of the collection.”There is no fragrance pyramid in O Hira, no notes given to consider outside of fossilized amber. But hidden within the simplicity is breathtaking depth, an amber that seems to contain sweet, rich, warm, spicy, powdery and smoky all at once, the kind of amber that almost makes one wonder if they're actually smelling it for the first time. With an almost unbelievable sillage and longevity, O Hira is a true testament to uncompromising quality, an approach mirrored in the elegant, genuine platinum-lettered bottle and hand-milled silver cap. For those who love amber fragrances above all others, O Hira demands to become the centerpiece of your collection.", Fossilized amber,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Nuit a Doha Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," While the 777 line is dedicated to paying tribute to the great cultures and natural ingredients of the Middle East, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is in no way fenced in by the conventions or styles of traditional middle eastern perfumery. And we're thankful for that, because Une Nuit Ã€ Doha, a soft, deliciously sweet immortelle and vanilla scent inspired by summer nights in the capital of Qatar, is nobody's idea of an indulgently rich Middle Eastern gourmand.Instead, it glows like a hazy, dreamlike moon, calm but deep, on a city night where the intensity of the day's heat has faded but not vanished. Warm winds carry the exotic scents of night markets: fennel, ginger, crystallized mandarin, while the sweetness of the immortelle blends into a comfortable brown tobacco from the neighborhood cafes, where games and conversations amongst old men run late into the night. As the base of creamy, beautiful vanilla absolute begins to warm, the fragrance hugs closer to the skin, drawing people together as the desert night seems to stretch on into eternity. This is seduction for adults- calm, assured, and utterly lovely.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal."," Fennel, crystallized mandarin, ginger, immortelle flower from Corsica, vetiver from HaÃ¯ti, brown tobacco, absolute of vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Magnolia Grandiflora - Sandrine Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora," Perfume lovers have long admired the author of the fiercely original Manoumalia, Sandrine Videault, a maverick artist who chose to work only on compositions she believed in, hence her tiny commercial production. Sandrine left us last year at a tragically early age. Her last gift to us, and to the Australian floral designer Saskia Havekes, whose soul and world Sandrine fell in love with, is her Magnolia Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Sandrine is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by Michel Roudnitska, the son of Sandrine's mentors, Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se. While Michel's magnolia is lush and sensuous, this fragrance captures magnolia on a summer morning in its first, luminous stage: a dewy rose-tinged bud, shimmering with the tangy zest of a grapefruit note.“It's probably the first time I detect a chypre accord in the flower”, Sandrine wrote.“I didn't know it existed in nature. For me, it was the most important thing to say about this Magnolia. Of course, this flower smells of lemon, and also conjures a certain moistness, but there are also fruity notes of melon, watermelon, earthy notes, etc.”A pure, graceful fragrance with a zest for life."," Lemon, grapefruit, white pepper, fresh garden accords, dry wood accords, marine-aquatic accords, musky accords",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vani Choc Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Vani Choc opens with a sparkling burst of lemon and bergamot, like fresh zested rind stirred into a bowl of vanilla, cream, and sugar. The citrus gradually melts into warm Madagascar vanilla and soft sandalwood. The result is an elegant gourmand - a rich creme caramel with subtle sugared cocoa and almond facets. Vani Choc is creamy, comforting and as can be imagined-- a dessert-inspired concoction that begs you to keep sniffing your wrists. It's unquestionably sweet, but the richness of vanilla is perfectly balanced with clean citrus and grounding wood notes. It's classic Hilde Soliani - a delicious, uplifting and addictive treat."," Citrus accord, vanilla, almond, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46629.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tendre est la Nuit Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Soft, aromatic, and animalic, Tendre est la Nuit evokes a cozy and sweet atmosphere that may result in indolence and languor. Majda Bekkali,“wanted to tell what may be the opposite of the noisy and turbulent world where we live...but when we extract ourselves from the noisy world, some danger lurks around and reason falters, the animality emerges.” An homage to Zelda Fitzgerald (wife of F. Scott) who not only hid in the shadows of her husband, but also in her own cocoon of madness, Tendre Est La Nuit is a scent that references darkness' magnetic appeal and the sweet idleness of a wandering mind.Created with perfumer Delphine Thierry, the top notes of immortelle flower and ambrette resemble the intoxication of GewÃ¼rztraminer wine; herbaceous davana and bright pepper notes serve as a lovely contrast to the mahogany, incense, and animalic notes that make an impression of danger that lurks around in the shadows of the night."," Corsican immortelle, ambrette and carrot seeds, cabreuva, davana, pepper, Sichuan pepper, benzoin, leather, labdanum, oakmoss, incense, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monsieur Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Monsieur is inspired by the exploration of a forest, where torrents and waterfalls from Auvergne's mountains carry along scents of moss, bark, wood, earth, and stone.  A harmonious blend of eight woody notes entwined with crushed leaves splashed by the mineral freshness of water spurting out of the rock.  Monsieur is a powerful, complex, and vibrant scent permeated with an organic sensuality.  It is both dry and green, mixing elements of grass, earth, crisp air currents, and damp stones.  Vetiver lovers will savor the soil-caked purity of the scent and wood aficionados will appreciate the elegant blend of poplar, cedar, and sandalwood - a true harmony of the forest in a fragrance."," Patchouli, Cedarwood, Vetiver and Sandalwood, Absolute of Poplar, Oakmoss, Incense Wood and Papyrus.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ashoka Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Inspired by a legendary ruler, Neela Vermeire's Ashoka, is a tribute to an emperor who was conquered by his own compassion at the moment his victory was assured. He converted to Buddhism and devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Buddha's teachings, to truth, to justice and to compassion for all living creatures beneath the sun. His own evolution from ruthless conqueror to benevolent emperor is reflected in Ashoka's journey from the fierce opening to a softly floral heart & the gentle embrace of its richly complex dry down.Ashoka is many things at once - it melds green, milky, earthy, and watery floral notes into one enticing and multifaceted scent.  The opening is a refreshing fig leaf, hyacinth, and lotus - but as soon as you think that the scent is all watery and green, the creamy and earthy personality capture you like quicksand - pulling you in and helping you discover fig milk, osmanthus, heliotrope, sandalwood, and a hint of vanilla.  These notes provide a velvety lactic quality that is altogether unexpected and totally irresistible.  The polarities of water and milk are not only perfectly balanced, but also enhanced and expanded by exotic florals of yang-ylang and jasmine, and grounding and robust notes of leather and vetiver.  Ashoka is a brilliant scent for both men and women looking for a complex yet comforting scent to be worn year-round."," Lotus, rose, water hyacinth, fig leaf, parsley leaf, Osmanthus absolute, cassie absolute, iris, incense essence, Jasmine sambac, fig milk, geranium, ylang-ylang, Fir balsam absolute, myrrh, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla accord, ambre gris, birch, Haitian vetiver, leather, styrax, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cologne Absolute Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," As the name would suggest, Cologne Absolute is Tom Daxon's take on a classic cologne, a fragrance at once supremely respectful of tradition and not at all beholden to it.  A beautifully rendered vision of soaring neroli layered with tart citrus, sharp aromatics and soft white flowers over an earthy base of patchouli and cypriol, Cologne Absolute conjures up the delightful feel of a jaunt to Italy in summertime; an easy, relaxed well-being that brightens and invigorates. It's fresh and sparkling and sunny. Unlike traditional colognes, however, Tom has taken these elements and distilled them into an Eau de Parfum strength elixir that keeps that magical, neroli-drenched sunshine lasting well into the evening hours."," Neroli, bergamot, tarragon, green violet leaf, lemon petitgrain, jasmine, lily of the valley, givescone, patchouli, cypriol",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sicilian Wood Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the scent of a citrus grove warming in the sun, Sicilian Wood is a quintessential Tom Daxon fragrance: powerfully evocative, fascinating in its evolution and, ultimately, equal parts surprising and satisfying. The opening is a vivid citrus that is instantly captivating.  The blend of lemon, tangerine and bergamot is startlingly realistic – you can feel that little squirt of juice as you peel off the skin of a tangerine.  There is a hint of sweetness – like freshly-squeezed orange juice – as we move to a blend of gentle lily of the valley and jasmine.  Then strong, resolute cedar and sandalwood appear and the soul of the fragrance is revealed: rich, confident wood with a twist of citrus."," Lemon, tangerine, bergamot, cardamom, gaiac wood, jasmine, lily of the valley, amber cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Resin Sacra Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," A meditation on the beauty of the ambiguous nature of frankincense.  An evocative shape-shifter, this tantalizing blend takes advantage of the diversity of its central ingredient to offer an experience both cool and church-like, and warm and sensual. A honeyed suede – sweet, soft and rich – cradles the frankincense as it emerges, creating an air of delicious opulence as resinous swirls of benzoin and cistus meld with the frankincense, leading it away from the gothic chill of stone and ceremony and celebrating its mesmerizing sensuality. And yet as the fragrance warms on the skin, the sweetness becomes less pronounced, and the transporting, ethereal side of frankincense emerges. We never cross fully to the sacred side, but those aspects of this compelling note keep the luxury in balance. Gorgeous and mystical."," Suede, frankincense, patchouli, benzoin Siam, cistus, ambroxan, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iridium Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," We don't know what fragrance James Bond tends to wear, but we're certain he'd make room in his rotation for Iridium. After all, just like the legendary super-spy himself, this genuinely elegant scent has a subtle, dangerously complex secret identity. Iridium opens with a cool martini-like blast of juniper. A teaser of carrot seed and angelica introduces a silvery iris. Gliding in as sleekly as a pristine 1964 Aston Martin DB5, the natural root-like earthiness gives way to a bracing glint of metal. A base of understated cedar and the enigmatic but irresistible Iso E Super adds warmth and depth. Iridium may be soft spoken, but never underestimate the seductive power hiding just beneath the surface."," Juniper, angelica, carrot seed, iris, vetiver, cedarwood, Iso E Super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salvia Sclarea Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon," A sweeping wind of brilliant spring green. Salvia sclarea is the botanical name for clary sage, and this fragrance is built around an outstanding clary sage note - clear, sparkling, with a touch of sweetness - blended with crisp grass and cool violet leaves to further deepen the sensation of endless green fields. The effect is not an orderly, manicured lawn, but rather a wild meadow, sprinkled with wildflowers and wet with dew. It is intensely, joyously, vibrantly green. Jasmine adds a clean floral freshness and oak moss, cashmeran and musk add a layer of velvety softness underneath, acting as supporting players in this ode to an early summer morning. Gorgeous, fresh and calming."," Grass, green violet leaf, bergamot, elemi, clary sage, jasmine, oakmoss, cashmeran, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Agua Magnoliana Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833," A glorious abundance of magnolia. The scent of the magnolia is delicate and intoxicating – clean and brisk with a squeeze of citrus and a honeyed sweetness on top. This fragrance is a tribute to Magnolia Amazonica -- the guardian trees of the Amazonian rainforests. They grow over 60 feet high and their luminous white flowers open at night, disseminating their euphoric scent in a dreamy tropical haze.  Imagine a hot and starry night when all of the thousands of fragile blossoms on the oversized tree unfurl their petals at the very same time, releasing an exuberant wave of transporting scent. Jasmine adds her flirtatious headiness to the mix and Indian sandalwood adds just enough warmth and weight to keep the whole thing from floating off into the ether like an escaped balloon. Agua Magnolia achieves that perfect balance of clean and sweet that we look for in a white floral. Ridiculously pretty.Agua Magnolia is from the Linneo collection, named in honor of Carl Linnaeus, a poet who became a naturalist. Each fragrance in this collection highlights a native South American plant."," Amazon magnolia, Santalum Album, grandiflorum jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Talc Gourmand Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Much like the indulgent desserts from which they draw inspiration, the best gourmand fragrances are deceptively complex, combining familiar notes in precise order to achieve something transcendent. And just as it takes years to train a master pastry chef, the expertise required to create a masterful gourmand knows no shortcut. So gourmand lovers everywhere should rejoice at the introduction of Talc Gourmand, the newest addition from a historic apothecary with a distinguished reputation for mouthwatering gourmand scents. Top notes of powdery talc and sweet caramel give way to a warm and luxuriously creamy vanilla and chocolate center. A sandalwood base adds richness and complexity in just the right proportion, ensuring that you won't have to wait until after your meal to enjoy this perfect indulgence."," Honey, caramel, vanilla flower, talcum powder, heliotrope, chocolate, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orgasmo Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," A swoon-inducing almond elixir that opens with a splash of Amaretto on the rocks.  Amaretto is the beloved Italian almond-flavored liqueur whose name means“a little bitter”, which it definitely is. However, it is also a little sweet, with a cherry-like fruitiness that counters the bitterness. That elusive bittersweet quality is at the heart of almond's appeal and is the centerpiece of this compelling scent. The almond note is full and complex, stepping forward after the intoxicating sweetness of the opening subsides. There is a creamy, dough-like quality underneath – not sugary cookie dough, but rich and buttery bread dough laced with almonds and fruit, with a whisper of salt. There are many elements of a comfort scent here, but the insistent, tantalizing thrum of almond's dark side keeps this enticingly dangerous.  An undercurrent of dry, cool wood gives this the dusky feel of rough velvet and distant smoke.  According to Hilde, this was inspired by drinking iced almond coffee on the beach with good friends. All we can say is that must have been some really special coffee and some really nice friends, because this sensuous scent evokes a feeling of true euphoria. Orgasmo has that hypnotic effect where you always want to take one more sniff... just one more. A must have for almond lovers."," almond, amaretto liqueur accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
J'ai Fait Un Reve - Obscur Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Eclectic and extraordinary, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve Pour Lui (formerly Songe pour Lui) is confident in its oppositions and perfectly at ease with taking any expectations you might have from reading its notes and blowing ”˜em all sky high. A vibrant and spicy pink pepper opens with a single foot-stomp of an entrance, sending the singular message that bold can be firm without being brash. Austere woods and soaring, golden notes like saffron and jasmine absolute balance each other's intensity, deep and earthy versus airy and rich. The longer you wear it, the more you notice its yin/yang nature...an exciting and fragrant journey for the senses that keeps unraveling as it goes along. Perfect for a man who enjoys the unknown twists and variety that J'ai Fait Un RÃªve Pour Lui offers."," Pink pepper, bergamot, Egyptian jasmine absolute, vanilla flower, oud, saffron, Moroccan atlas cedar and cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
J'ai Fait Un Reve - Clair Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Both deep and ethereal, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve is like falling into dream. The opening is the sweet descent, a gentle fall down, down, down, with the smell of orange-like notes and orange blossom trailing along. The dream shifts, with a warm jasmine twisting sensually on a bed of precious woods and light incense, and the pulse is taken up a notch with labdanum, cumin and leather. Before things get too heated, an illuminating white musk begins to weave in, imbuing the fragrance with soft, clean notes and creating a sense of contentment and happiness. No dark edges here, just a wonderful center with depth around which a light musk swirl and dances without a care."," Petitgrain, elemi, cumin, currant leaves, orange blossom, jasmine, lisylang, castoreum, white musk, white cedar, guaiac, leather, labdanum, incense and papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fusion Sacree - Clair Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Fusion SacreÃ© for her is a bewitching elixir from the hands of L'Artisan's main nose, Bertrand Duchaufour. The opening is a little unexpected, with hints of blackcurrant and citrusy bergamot and clementine tinged with coffee, a note that comes out more as the perfume melds with your skin. Heady florals like gardenia, jasmine and orange blossom meet their match with a deep base of fir, cedar, and patchouli. It's then that this beautiful brew unveils its soul as it revels in the push/pull of opposing force, letting each of the notes unfold before evolving to something new. A sweet vanilla finish is expertly tampered with benzoin and musk creating a warm, radiating finish that is so smooth it inspires half-lidded eyes and reverie.","fir, cedar, patchouli, jasmine, orange blossom, vanilla, musk, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fusion Sacree - Obscur Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," L'Artisan's Bertrand Duchaufour is the nose behind Fusion SacreÃ© for him, and his masterful hand has created a perfume so deep, warm and boozy-woody thick/sweet that our eyes rolled back in our heads and we started muttering incoherently. It opens with a flourish of opulent spices and a brush of lavender...but it's quickly bowled over by an aged wooden cask of rum. It's a big, bold frigate ship of a fragrance, its wild and unbridled boozy notes enriched by coffee, spiked by cloves, sweetened by vanilla & caramel, and touched with tuberose. Narcotic and emotional, if it were a color, it would be dark brown and resinous... slow-flowing and teeth-grindingly delicious."," Rum, citron, celery, sweet orange, neroli, cardamom, lavender, davana, bergamot, white coffee, tuberose absolute, cloves, geranium, sweet william pear, liquorice, benzoin resinoid, opoponax resinoid, ambergris, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, caramel and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mon Nom Est Rouge Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali," Desire, passion, beauty and seduction...all are associated with the color red, and Mon Nom Est Rouge brazenly bares all and dares you to look. The velvety depths of a vibrant Turkish rose are plundered, an indomitable and timeless scent that is both powerful and leans neither masculine nor feminine; it just“is.” Amber, musk and incense keep a firm hold on the rose, while the woods and gourmand spices are free to run amok. Mon Nom Est Rouge rules with a velvet glove, a serene and expressive perfume redolent with rose and depth...but don't mistake it for meek. Captivating and enveloping."," Pepper, lemon, elemi, pink pepper, metallic affect, Turkish rose, geranium, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, incense, woody balsamic, cedar, sandalwood, amber, vanilla, labdanum, patchouli, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Platino,Omnia Profumo," A transcendently light almond-infused meringue drizzled with coconut, caramel and vanilla.  Platino is definitely delicious, but it is also frothy and airy, which is unexpected given the rich dessert-like notes it incorporates. The luscious blend of gourmand elements is buoyed by exquisitely delicate jasmine and mimosa and the result is a dreamy cloud cake that floats effortlessly over the drudgery of the everyday world, trailing a gentle puff of powder.  This is not a simple bonbon, but a confection of the highest order, intricately layered to seduce and delight us. The insistent hint of bitterness from the almond counters the sugary caramel and the cool filigree of white flowers balances the cozy warmth of the soft musk.  Delectable and comforting , but with enough contradictions to keep us intrigued for a very long time."," Whipped cream, coconut, caramel, almond milk, jasmine, mimosa, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme infini Eau de Parfum,Divine," Yann Vasnier has a history of creating outstanding men's scents for Divine, and L'homme infini, his latest creation for the line, does not disappoint. Resolutely masculine and warmly reassuring, this has the confident ease of a man who has all the time in the world, surveying the vast horizon to see the next adventure ahead.  The opening is an effervescent and distinctive blend of green and spice, featuring coriander (both leaf and grain), elemi and a very present black pepper. There is a lovely invigorating sparkle that reminds us of freshly chopped ginger that continues to tingle and fizz even as the heart of oak, cedar and agar wood reveals itself. The woods are majestic and gorgeous – a rich and resinous forest out of legend. Oak, cedar and agar wood layer warmth, strength and a hint of mystery. Vetiver adds a dry earthiness which plays well with the lingering pepperiness, while amber and benzoin bring out the warm, burnished glow of the wood. Elegant and nuanced, this is a scent of endless possibilities, suitable for both the serene lord of the manor and the swashbuckling stranger that swaggers up to challenge his claim."," Coriander leaf and grain, elemi, black pepper, oak, cedar, agar wood, vetiver, amber, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22711.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cristina Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Hilde Soliani's Cristina is part of her Gli Invisibili collection, and aptly so, as the scent is a subtle, comforting cloak of earth and amber like a guardian angel.  Cristina is named after one of Hilde's best friends, who loved the fragrance so much that she became the namesake.  Appropriately, the theme of friendship and duality is prevalent in the fragrance. Cristina combines two types of rare patchouli as essential ingredients in the composition; each bringing out the best in the other. The patchouli notes in Cristina have a subtle feeling of Incense and Oud-like familiarity, as if they possess the wisdom of multiple lifetimes. Vanilla and cistus labdanum provide the comforting heart of the fragrance, acting as the glowing center upon which the duet of patchouli thrives. Cristina defies all expectation of a patchouli fragrance, and even those that thought they were not patchouli lovers will be proven wrong."," Patchouli, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poudre de Riz Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Inspired by a line in the 1908 novel L'Enfer by Henri Barbusse...“The air in the disordered shuttered room was heavy with a mixture of odours: Soap, face powder, the sharp tang of cologne...”Poudre de Riz is a soft insinuating blend of rose petals, rice powder, monoi flowers and vanilla. Nostalgic and sensuous it conjures up the langour and luxury of Edwardian afternoons, the scent of beautiful clothes and elegant rooms permeated with rare and exotic flowers. Powdery, creamy and tactile but with an intriguing retro charm."," Damask rose, tiare absolute, coconut, vanilla, rice powder accord (caramelic, burnt toast and maple notes), sandalwood, iris, cedar, tonka bean, Tolu balsam and benzoin resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
450 Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," If we could smell the woods, meadows and flower garlands depicted in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera, their spring beauty might very well resemble 450 by Farmacia SS Annunziata, named after the 450 Jubilee of the ancient Farmacia, which was established in the year of 1561 in the San Nicolo monastery.450 gives the impression of being a rustic floral, the marriage of its notes joined together by the wind and sealed with kisses from the sun. With its brisk, aromatic citrus top notes, light rosy floral heart tempered by woods, and its ambery-musky base with a touch of incense, 450 is spring in all its rawness, freshness, and warmth. In the drydown, woodsy florals are softened by Florentine orris with its powdery, earthy gentleness and the ambery-vanillic sweetness of coumarin.A perfect unisex fragrance for hot weather, 450 could easily adorn (and cool off) the wearer of a seersucker suit or a white linen dress. Fresh, transparent, warm ”” and divine."," Musk, Iris of Florence, Amber, Aromatic notes, Incense, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Emir Eau de parfum,M. Micallef," M. Micallef's latest creation, Emir, flaunts the use of complex and raw natural materials, in a unique East meets West composition. The splendid heart of oud and leather is gently softened by cedar and patchouli, giving it a comforting and resinous appeal. Savory pepper notes give this scent a masculine edge, and notes of orange and grapefruit perk it up, bringing it out of the agarwood forest and into the light. As it develops on the skin, Emir reveals a softer side of geranium and white musk, rounding out its olfactory composition perfectly. The ideal blend of oud, smoke, sweet, and spice, Emir is the perfect distinctive masculine fragrance to wear anytime, for any occasion."," orange, grapefruit, geranium, oud, black pepper, patchouli, cedarwood, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bombay Bling Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," ""This joyful creation embodies every aspect of the very modern, colorful, eclectic, esoteric, ecstatic, liberal, happy side of buzzing India"", Neela Vermeire explains. And what a buzz Bombay Bling is, starting with the bang of a huge, raspy green mango before exploding into a vibrant, tropical blend of jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, plumeria and gardenia.This extravagantly lavish bouquet is rooted in wood and tobacco notes, which give it an intriguing hint of masculinity. Lads who feel they can rock white florals could give this a try. Ladies who want to unleash their inner Bollywood diva will look no further. Bottle design allows for either splash or atomizer spray (included)"," Mango, lychee, blackcurrant, cardamom, cumin, cistus, Turkish rose, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, tuberose, plumeria, gardenia, patchouli, tobacco, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohur Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name refers to the most valuable gold coin in India's history, the last of which was minted in 1918. A way, perhaps, of underlining the value given to perfumery during the Mogul era, an art so highly considered that the most powerful empress of the Mughal dynasty, Noor Jahan, devoted herself to perfecting it.Though Mohur is built on the classic Eastern accord of rose and oud, with its powdery orris accords it also manages to conjure the opulence of classic French fragrances. It is also, despite the richness of its floral accords, a unisex scent, with leather effects alluding to high tea after a polo match in the British Raj, and perhaps a whiff of fine-milled English soap.But the real surprise in Mohur is the subtle Indian pastry accord tucked in the petals of its rose garden, with notes of carrot, almond, cardamom and ambrette, lending a tender touch to this majestic composition. If Patou had been Indian, this would have been Joy...Bottle design allows for either splash or atomizer spray (included)"," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot, black pepper, elemi,  Turkish rose oil, jasmine, orris, hawthorn, almond milk accord, leather, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, oudh Palao from Laos, benzoin, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Trayee Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name means ""triad"", an allusion to the sacred origin of the first three Vedas, the most ancient sacred texts in India. The notes are drawn from the ingredients used in religious rituals and ayurvedic medicine during the Vedic era. Rich in incense, myrrh and oud, the fragrance is a poignant blend of smoke, spices and resins that harks back to the very origins of perfumery ”” a burnt offering to the gods and an aid to meditation.Bertrand Duchaufour has always excelled at bringing transparency to dark resinous notes, and he surpasses himself in the smoky blend: Trayee is amazingly facetted, with green (basil, cardamom, cassis), floral (jasmine), spicy (ginger, cinnamon, clove), leather (saffron, oud), smoky (vetiver, sandalwood) and balsamic (myrrh, vanilla) effects, dominated by the quintessentially Indian fragrances of sandalwood and jasmine. The perfumer has even added an arrestingly realistic ganja accord, a memory of the sadus he ran across during his trips in India.Trayee's smoky tendrils may not have consciousness-altering effects, but we suspect that the gorgeous natural materials in the formula might be aromatherapeutic. Beauty heals."," Blue ginger, elemi, cinnamon, ganja accord, blackcurrant absolute, basil, jasmine sambac, Egyptian jasmine, cardamom absolute, clove, saffron, Javanese and Haitian vetiver, incense, Mysore sandalwood oil, patchouli, myrrh, vanilla, cedar, amber notes, oud palao from Laos, oak moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Myrrhiad Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," The amazingly prolific Pierre Guillaume adds a ninth scent to HuitiÃ¨me Art, a line dedicated to rare natural organic ingredients and original accords based on novel“plant captures”. But this time, instead of pear tree bark or organic Moroccan verbena, he tackles one of the most ancient and sacred aromatic ingredients known to mankind: myrrh.Myrrh resin is an olfactory world in itself, with bitter, ambery and balsamic facets. Guillaume, who has always had a bent for gourmand notes, amplifies those facets by matching them with a cocktail of vanillas to boost the balsamic effects. The cool burn of licorice draws the blend towards mouth-watering darkness shot with green glints of anise and milky almond plushness.But the real surprise springs from the splash of black tea absolute that soaks the bittersweet potion with smoky, tarry, almost animalic effects, and turn into a gloriously dark, smooth leather scent.Myrrhiad conjures the sacred and erotic origins of perfume. Whether you wear it to connect with your inner Wise Man or priestess, or for a seduction ritual, is entirely up to you."," Myrrh, black tea absolute, vanilla, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oro Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," The power of gold (oro) has tugged at the human soul for millennia, bringing with it intense emotions and indescribable beauty and artistry. Translating gold's majesty and possibilities from the senses of touch and sight to smell was a Herculean task, and one Omnia Profumo spared no expense in doing. Oro is a shaded glen dappled with golden light, scented with light touches of fresh lemon and bergamot that meld with a breeze carrying a zingy, wild cyclamen. The breeze picks up with a gust of peony, lavender and spring lilac, and bids farewell as a rich and sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds. The vanilla-like coumarin and exquisite sandalwood are perfect accompaniments-- you didn't think a perfume called Oro would be a coquettish giggle of a perfume, right?  Don't assume it's overly heavy or ostentatious; Oro is feminine and sexy without trying too hard, that just-right combo of sweet and dark that will have people running the wrong way down an escalator to ask you what you're wearing."," Lemon, Bergamot, Cyclamen, Lavender, Lilac, Peony, Patchouly Sandalwood, Coumarin, Incense, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Conaffetto Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," A delightful, romantic filigree of almonds, sugar and soaringly lovely orange blossom. Created for a dear friend's wedding, Soliani was inspired by“confetti” – the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy – and around the world.  You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower.  Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d'oranger – a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers. We can't imagine a more perfect scent for a wedding – but you don't need to be a bride to love this. Any time you want to dab on a dose of sheer joy, this would be appropriate."," Orange blossom, almond, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," Let's face it: Patchouli can be maddening to describe because it smells like nothing else in the world but patchouli. Yes, it's earthy and rich, but those adjectives fail to conjure up the hypnotic, evocative qualities that make patchouli so distinctive. Luckily, if we simply state the obvious – Patchouli Nobile is a patchouli scent – we have a good place to begin because we all know that deep, highly recognizable note. The question is, is it a good patchouli scent? Happily, the answer is yes. In fact, it's not just a good patchouli scent, it's a great one: It seduces without resorting to brute force, it has a caressing amber-tinged sweetness that nestles into the loamy richness of clean earth and smooth wood and it retains the dry freshness of its opening of incense and pepper. It is both elegantly refined and devastatingly sexy. The patchouli is absolutely present, but it's not overpowering, and the layers of sandalwood, oak moss, amber and tonka add a luxurious, velvety quality that makes this superbly wearable. It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of patchouli, you need to try this, but we feel that this cozy and alluring scent has the potential to win new converts to the patchouli cult, as well. Outstanding."," Citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine Moroccan cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Estroverso Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," A sparkling burst of lemon, orange and tangerine gives this lively scent an opening as dazzling as the sun bursting through clouds. Estroverso is a combination of estro – the Italian word of inspiration and intuition – and verso (against)  -- and it is meant to convey that drive to follow inspiration against all odds. It is the passion of invention and creation, and that stubborn streak that compels you to pursue your dreams even when things look hopeless. The vivid citrus and herbs dance over a complex mÃ©lange of vetiver, ambergris, cedar and musk. This has the classic eau de cologne structure, but  heightened. The citrus is extra bright and the base is rich and complex. And there is a little bit of something edgy in there; we are assuming it's the mugwort, because it is what we would imagine a plant with startling healing properties and possible magical applications would smell like – green and potent. Overall, a scintillating potion that will keep you upbeat and alert while waiting for inspiration to strike."," Lemon, Orange, Tangerine, Lime, Rosemary, Mugwort, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Patchouly, Musk, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942," A classic amber scent, impeccably done. Warm, powdery and  soothing. A fresh citrus and orange blossom opening leads us to the heart of ambergris, labdanum and patchouli. There is a startling hint of salt and stone in the transition and, though we quickly move past that into a smooth and comforting blend of tonka bean, vetiver, cedar and sandalwood, there is something intriguingly solid and cool beneath all the warm elements. This is a fragrance with presence: It has a soft, satisfying sweetness, but it's not candied or syrupy. It's calming, but it feels much too sophisticated to describe it as cozy. The word that leaps to mind is regal. It feels as if this was created for the exclusive use of nobility and we managed to sneak a bottle out of the palace for ourselves. Don't we all deserve to be treated like royalty sometimes? Pure elegance."," Neroli, Bergamot, Ambergris, Labdanum, Patchouly, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Note Vanillee Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," We usually think of vanillas as of good girl scents, cozy scents, comforting scents... Micallef's Note Vanillee, with its impish licorice accord and a boozy undertone of cognac and rum is a girl gone bad, very, very bad. We can't get enough of the honeyed piquancy of the perfume, with its juicy mandarin and its seductive jasmine; the base of sandalwood, vanilla and smoky, sweet tobacco, rum and cognac is sinfully delicious. Micallef celebrates the fragrance“Note VanillÃ©e” in its new Art Collection, exclusively available at Luckyscent. The flacon is decorated with clear crystals and the exquisite silver-colored cap completes the touch of elegance that radiates from the flacon. It is more than a flacon, more than a perfume; it is a unique creation, a work of art."," mandarin, jasmine, honey, licorice, sandalwood, vanilla, cognac, rum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beachwood Eau de Parfum,Costamor," Costa Rica translates to rich coast and no perfume theme built around the country could be without a fragrant valentine to its amazing coastline. Beachwood moves away from the tourist hotspots and takes you to a sheltered cove on a protected beach.  A crescent of white sand backs up against a forested cliff while aquamarine water glistens and rolls and the clean, untouched aquatic notes fill the air. The subtle hints of jasmine, neroli and coconut serve notice that you are indeed in a tropical landscape, and woods, lavender and bergamot remind you of the forest on the cliffs.  Light, effortless and calm, Beachwood is light and easy to wear- making it a perfect choice for an everyday fragrance."," Bergamot, Mandarin, Neroli, Jasmine, Coconut, Cedar wood, Sandalwood, Amber, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sugarwood Eau de Parfum,Costamor," A soft, woody--almost gourmand-like perfume-- with a surprise twist: the sweet and strikingly fresh scent of newly cut sugar cane. Sugar cane is a cultivated crop in Costa Rica but it thrives so well in the idyllic climate that you find it growing wild, ready to be savored on a whim. This cherished treat inspired Sugarwood, which features sugar cane pulp as a primary note. Luscious fig complements the sweetness, while warm cedar evokes the woody aspect of the plant. Gentle floral notes - ethereal jasmine, lilting peony and a powdery iris - meld beautifully to create a feminine scent that is the ideal balance of sweet and sophisticated."," Bergamot, fig, sugar cane pulp, peony, jasmine, musk, iris, vanilla, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Divine Eau de Parfum,Divine," The ninth fragrance by Divine sees this estimable house introduce its first unisex eau de parfum. As the name would imply, Eau Divine perfectly balances the bracing freshness of an eau with the warm sensuality that characterizes the Divine fragrances. Masculine and feminine, tender and sharp, this play of opposites achieves a perfect unity. Imagine an intricately carved Waterford crystal goblet. The beveled clarity captures and refracts pure light while the vessel sits with impressive weight in your hand. When you strike the lead crystal to propose a toast, it resonates with an impeccable purity. Eau Divine begins with a sunny blast of Italian citrus and orange blossom with spicy notes of ginger, nutmeg and star anise gently hovering in the periphery. The scintillating start begins to settle, allowing the warmth of violet to emerge. Seductive traces of amber and labdanum lead the journey into a candle-lit enclave bounded by draped velvet.  Unpredictable and complex, Eau Divine is a sophisticated fragrance perfectly suited for a man or woman of utter refinement."," Green mandarin, star anise, ginger, nutmeg, orange flower, violet, cardamom, white amber, labdanum, hot musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Il Vs Iris Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Il Vs Iris, Hilde Soliani's ode to the precious flower, might be the most charming take on iris. The most surprising too, because the soft, child-like initial impression of the scent fools the wearer into believing that it is a simple, uncomplicated blend. .But wait for the fresh, gently rooty floral top notes to subside, and you will be startled by the beautiful dry greenness of the next accord, woody and verdant, a peppery smell of young leaves and twigs. Wait a little longer, and you will see why we believe that this enchanting composition would delight not only lovers of iris, but also fans of almond and heliotrope. The honeyed nuttiness of almond is not too sweet, just enough to make the perfume downy and soft, fluffy, innocent and unexpectedly sensual. Absolutely adorable!"," Orris root, green pepper, almond, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acquiiissssima Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," With Acquiilssssima, Hilde Soliani translates haute cuisine into haute parfumerie. Inspired by a dish created by an Italian chef, the scent blends the salty, mineral, fresh aroma of the sea with green tea and jasmine. Those wary of aquatic scents need not be afraid. The saline, subtly, strangely animalic, seaweedy-green smell of the sea is unmistakable here, but it does not lend the composition that aggressively fresh quality so typical of marine fragrances. The pairing of this verdant saltiness and sweet jasmine petals is unexpected, striking and truly sublime. The watery and the floral aspects of the blend are tied together with a green tea note, which possesses qualities of the both, and which lends Acquiilssssima delicate its translucency and a calm, airy feel. A chef-d'oeuvre!"," seaweed, jasmine, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fraaagola Saalaaata Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani," Fraaagola Saalaaata, a surprising mix of strawberries and... salt, is a playful, unexpectedly subversive scent, a composition with two sides, sweet and forceful. Elegant and humorous, the perfume is like no other that we know. Try as we might we can't come up with anything like its unique mixture of pulpy, juicy, fruity innocence and strangely saline, at times almost earthy sensuality. Simple and enigmatic, sweet and fresh, summery and deep...This is haute cuisine, or rather haute parfumerie at its absolute best!", Strawberry salt,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'etre Aime - Femme Eau de Parfum,Divine," At the heart of our lives is a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Yvon Mouchel created the 7th addition to the world of Divine around this theme. Linked to its masculine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© femme (”œthe beloved woman”) also shares with it the note that lies in its heart: the everlasting flower with its warm, intense, sunny aroma. The feminine l'Ãªtre aimÃ© enhances the sun-filled quality of helichrysium with the bright, juicy citrus top notes. The dazzling accord of neroli, bergamot and nectarine gracefully leads to the equally radiant bouquet of the middle notes, in which everlasting flowers are mixed with jasmine, lily and rose. The base notes of amber, sandalwood vetiver and vanilla are trademark Divine, lush and elegant, the classic French perfumery at its best."," neroli, bergamot, nectarine, jasmine, lily, tincture of rose, everlasting flowers, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," An elegant and dry amber with a sparkling citrus opening. Despite the presence of heavy-hitter base notes like opoponax and patchouli, Ambra feels sheer and refined. The sweetness of the amber and vanilla is balanced with the sharp pepperiness of lavender and a cool, meditative blend of incense notes. This is an amber that is spare, rather than opulent, with a brisk spiciness that complements the sensuous warmth and makes this versatile and easy to wear. If you have been looking for an amber that is wearable day or night and that works in warm weather as well as cool, this is the one. It still has that golden, hypnotic quality that makes amber so addictive, but it is dry and subtle enough to work as an everyday fragrance."," Orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Madera Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo," Delicious, dreamy caramel. If you are a fan of foodie scents, this is for you. It is a giant vat of golden, buttery caramel goodness ready for you to dip yourself in like a carnival apple. Rich vanilla and creamy coconut give this a hint of Mounds bar yumminess (without the chocolate), and a whipped cream smoothness comes from the soft musk and gentle flowers. But mostly, there is caramel – absolutely decadent and sticky-toffee sweet, comforting and enveloping and warm. This is the gooey center of a delicious candy– molten sugar and cream cooked oh-so-slowly until it magically transforms. We've rarely encountered a scent that captured the lusciousness of caramel so well . As you know, many of the sugar-laced scents and lotions in the mass market veer into the bitter, plasticky realm as they wear on the skin”” but this one miraculously does not. Madera has achieved caramel perfection and stays creamy and delectable all the way through. Truly scrumptious."," Vanilla pod, caramel, Madagascar vanilla, peach blossom, wildflowers, tobacco flower, coconut, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Onice Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," Not every fragrance can be described in a line or two – some take a winding path to get to their destination. Onice is one of those fragrances. It opens with a fresh, green, vegetal note. We smell celery, which isn't listed in the notes. Then we get the beginnings of a dense and complicated sweetness that reminds us of immortelle, which is also not listed in the notes. Just when we are about to ignore the notes altogether we get a definite dollop of licorice and a delightfully sweet pineapple – both listed and both very present as they waltz with a variety of partners. Delicate hyacinth, sharp mint, earthy cedar, a dusting of nutmeg. It's an enchanting and unusual journey, that appears to lead to different places for different people– on some Onice is sweet and fruity, on others the green and wood notes dominate. The consensus is that it is light and fresh without being aquatic or soapy or citrus”” and that it is very hard to pin down exactly what it smells like, although we all agree that it smells quite good. Intriguing."," citrus, anise, lavender, licorice, peach, pineapple, rose, nutmeg, geranium, hyacinth, jasmine, ylang, mint, sandalwood, musk, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vaniglia del Madagascar Parfum Concentration,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A classic, full-bodied vanilla – rich, creamy and sweet – that is a prime example of why vanilla scents are so very beloved. A hint of citrus leads to a delectable fruitiness and then it is full-on vanilla in all its luscious, craving-inducing glory. There are a lot of vanilla scented things in the world, but as any passionate vanilla fan will tell you, they are not all created equal. Quality matters, and a finely crafted vanilla scent is as different from the plasticky, mass-marketed versions as leather is from vinyl. It is no surprise that Farmacia SS Annunziata has given us a superlative version that is tantalizingly edible and utterly seductive. Floral grace notes and velvety amber add warmth and complexity, but they are in the mix as supporting players – dreamy, delicious vanilla is the star attraction here, and she deserves her spotlight. A must try for those looking for their Holy Grail vanilla scent."," lemon, floral notes, amber notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Reve en Cuir Eau de Parfum,Indult," Reve en Cuir was created by Francis Kurkdjian, the perfumer whose talent and work we admire, as an Indult for Scent Bar fragrance. Knowing our love for leather, you will not be surprised to learn that this Luckyscent exclusive is built on the rich leather accord. The traditional citrusy top notes are given a modern twist by the inclusion of spices, cardamom and cloves, and oregano. Instead of being typically fresh, bergamot and lemon in Reve en Cuir have a delicately candied quality and set the tone of the composition with a rich, indolent feel. Cedar and patchouli enhance the smoky character of the leather while never allowing it to become tarry. Oakmoss and vetiver lend the scent that elegantly earthy character that we adore in classical masculine perfumes, while vanilla compliments the citrusy-spicy side of the blend, softening the sharp angles and making Reve en Cuir indeed dreamy and sensual. Spicy, smoky leather with a dangerously appealing soft side – we fall for that every time. Reve en Cuir was conceived as a masculine creation, but as every woman who has ever borrowed her boyfriend's leather jacket knows – some rules are made to be broken."," Bergamot, Lemon, Cardamom, Oregano, Clove Bud, Texan Cedarwood, Patchouli, Oak Moss, Haitian Vetyver, Crystallized Vanilla Recent Press New York Times' Chandler Burr gives Reve en Cuir  Five Stars'Leather ”” old, dark, smoky, heavy ”” is diabolically difficult to adapt to an accessible 21st-century format.

Patchouly Indonesiano Parfum ...,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," When we got the breakdown of notes for this line, we couldn't help but giggle when we first saw the listing for this fragrance. Head note: Indonesian patchouli, Heart note: Indonesian patchouli, Base note: Indonesian patchouli. But we stopped giggling and started swooning when we sniffed the actual fragrance, because yes – there is that much patchouli in it, and wow--it is absolutely gorgeous. The opening is dry, almost medicinal, then a grand and exotic symphony of dark, chewy sweetness and fresh-tilled earth appear and it is pure, mesmerizing, exotic, no-holds barred, patchouli splendor from that point on. This feels forbidden and irresistible, like an antique trunk full of contraband – but it also has the lush, damp greeness of the forest floor. All of the complexities and contradictions of this enigmatic note - the golden opulence, the herbaceous sharpness – are gloriously present. If you hate patchouli, this will not be your cup of tea.  But if you love it, rejoice--this is one of the most fabulous renditions we have ever encountered. It's the patchouliest!", Patchouli from Indonesia,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Nera Parfum ...,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A regal fragrance that balances the sultry warmth of vanilla and benzoin with icy eucalyptus and dignified cedar. At the center: A cool-headed amber, with all of its passionate excesses in check, but still glowing just below the surface.  Ambra Nera smells powerful and controlled; the delirious sensuality of amber percolates and teases, but never overwhelms the aristocratic architecture of the fragrance. Grounded by earthy vetiver and and dark patchouli, laced with wood, burnished and sweetened by just the right amount of creamy vanilla – this is an amber that is elegant, as well as opulent. Timelessly appealing, this shimmers with the subdued fire of an opal.  A stunning version of one of our favorite notes."," cypress, eucalyptus, amber, benzoin, vetiver, vanilla, patchouly",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chia Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A deliriously extravagant confection of spun-sugar flowers, kissed with citrus and filled with marzipan. Flirtatious and delicious, Chia wears its giddy, candied heart on its sleeve and revels proudly in its unabashed sweetness.  The opening spins candy floss, orange and a soft, powdery rose into a shimmering gossamer strand that wraps around the sweet almond note that takes center stage. A luscious blend of hazelnut, vanilla, and musk adds creaminess and depth, but never overpowers the almond or the flourishes of candy coated rose that give this the feel of a very elegant and rare candy. Charming and delectable."," almond, orange, rose, candyfloss, hazelnut, vanilla, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cara Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Like taking a bite out of a meringue – the initial sugar crystal sweetness that melts into soft vanilla on your tongue, the powdery sensation of chewing the puffy white cloud of a cookie, the striking combination of richness and delicacy. Cara takes some of our favorite gourmand notes – sweet almond, golden caramel and milky vanilla – and makes them soft and airy by folding in dusky amber and talcum. The marshmallow sweet opening mellows into a dreamy vanilla-tinged veil of powder that melts into the skin, soothing and delicious. This is as comforting as a favorite cashmere throw, yet sophisticated enough to qualify as utterly grown up. The perfect thing to reach for when facing a thunderstorm or the possibility of running into an ex. Gentle and delicious, this is a must try for fans of vanilla or almond."," Amber, caramel, almond, talcum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Takis Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Streamlined and modern.  Dazzlingly sharp lemon and peppery sage set the stage with a brisk, take-no-prisoners policy, and a clean musk and straightforward rose sweep through with equal efficiency. But when a majestic blend of velvety vanilla, exotic ylang ylang and mellow aged oak rolls in, everything slows down and brisk, angular edges are transformed into the smooth, burnished lines of a contemporary sculpture.  Rounded and warm, with a sweet soapiness that is at once familiar and brand new -- like a new, improved soapiness that is a little bit spicier, a little bit creamier, a little bit more of everything we like about soap. Takis can range from a heightened skin scent to seductive night-on-the town scent once it settles in, depending on the chemistry of the wearer. Sophisticated and polished."," Lemon, thyme, sage, rose, musk, ylang ylang, vanilla, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perla Eau de Toilette,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A lovely yellow lemon drop – the perfect blend of sour and sweet  -- melts into a shimmering apricot glow as dollops of fluffy vanilla float by, like the pink tinged clouds of a fantastical sunrise.  An ambrosial summer blend – citrus and vanilla  - is taken to new heights by adding the magical radiance of osmanthus – at once floral and fruity, ethereal and adamantly present. Like its namesake, Perla is absolutely luminous on skin, with a sweetness that beckons rather than overwhelms and a dreamy, enveloping warmth. This makes us smile and we imagine that it will make everyone around us smile, as well. Transportingly pretty."," Lemon, osmanthus, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Muska Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," Just like in Baudelaire's poem, the sensual aroma of musk in Micallef's Royal Muska,“sings, transporting the soul and sense.” Infused with the creamy sensuality of the indolent flowers of ylang ylang and with the honeyed opulence of roses, the fragrance is exotic and infinitely feminine. The base of benzoin and ripe fruits puts a delicious twist on the composition, giving it a tropical air. This is the scent of tanned skin, of hot days and sultry nights, the heavenly aroma of passionate paradise."," ylang ylang, rose, precious woods, white musks, fruits, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Oud Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," As far as we are concerned, there can't be too many great vanilla scents and there certainly can't be too many aouds. Combine the two, and we are smitten. We are addicted to this unique combo of creamy, dreamy vanilla and spicy, resinous aoud. It is a perfect yin and yang harmony. The caramel-like sweetness of vanilla mixed with ylang-ylang and prune softens the starkness of aoud. Oud, in turn, prevents the vanilla accord from being too predictably foodie and infantile. This is a vanilla fragrance for those who usually shy away from vanillas... and a perfect starter scent for those curious about ouds."," bergamot, ylang-ylang, prune, oud, caramel, musk, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gaiac Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," The aroma of gaiac is complex, eluding definition. The precious wood smells balsamic and fresh, sweet and earthy and smoky. Micallef's rendition of gaiac is fittingly complex, inclusive of the many facets of the scent. Bergamot and jasmine infuse the blend with freshness, cloves add spice, vetiver brings out the earthiness of the wood and vanilla sweetens the blend, softening the sharp angles, turning Gaiac into a sensual and tranquil perfume, with a your-skin-but-better base. Perfect for men and women."," bergamot, jasmine, cloves, gaiac, vetiver, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Homme (Aoud) Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," Micallef's spicy, honeyed rendition of precious aoud, with its mix of golden saffron and dark-red roses, is sensual and wonderfully exotic. The dry smokiness of the fragrance makes us think of the ritual in Arabia, in which women stand over an oud burner, perfuming their skin and clothes with the unique, enthralling fragrance. Balmily sweet and spicily bitter, Micallef's Aoud is a complex, endlessly intriguing scent. It is said that sandalwood is the fragrance for novices, while aoud is for those“in the know”. Micallef's refined creation is our treat for true connoisseurs."," rose, aoud, sandalwood, cinnamon, saffron, nutmeg, honey, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Avant Garde Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef," The new masculine offering from Martine Micallef delivers the great promise of its name. The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible. The base of tonka bean and amber finishes the development on a softer and wonderfully sensual note. Charismatic blend that feels as contemporary as it is classically elegant."," bergamot, grapefruit, cocoa bean, tobacco, incense, Russian leather, tonka bean, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Manakara Eau de Parfum,Indult," The second we smelled this, we were positively overcome by its exotic yet approachable beauty. Named for a village in Madagascar known for its legendary lychee fruit (also spelled litchi), it's presented here as a sweet, honeyed and mysterious floral-tinged pudding-like fruit fragrance with amazing hidden depths -- not purple berry fruit, not bright citrus fruit, but rich and delicate lychee, a scent that's like tropical fruits meets ripe red fruits with a soft, creamy floral mixed in. We've never smelled anything quite like it --  ever -- and we had gourmand lovers, fruity fans, floral worshippers and even deep, dangerous fragrance lovers sampling this and positively banging their wrists on the counter demanding to buy it...and we didn't even carry it yet.  A custardy, creamy sweet fruit dessert of a perfume laced with rose water, we can't compare it to anything you've ever tried before and we're quite certain you'll be utterly smitten by this rare beauty. Moist, sweet, rich and delicate...all at the same time."," rose, lychee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isvaraya Eau de Parfum,Indult," In India, patchouli is associated with Vishnu, the god savior of mankind and life and the guardian of universal harmony.  Isvaraya means“divine” in Hindi and this perfume is the olfactory fantasy of both modern India and spiritual India, an exotic elixir that blends light patchouli with smooth Indian plum tree and wraps it in jasmine. Although it centers on patchouli, it's not overly earthy. It's rich and unusual, slightly sweet and a tad smoky, a fevered evening spent on multi-hued silken sheets while wisps of incense burn sensually in the corners of your mind. The beautiful starkness of jasmine lights the darkness of patchouli and the deep, spiced fruitiness of the plum tree... utterly unique and completely exotic, Isvaraya is not a fluffy little fragrance you wear without thinking. When you smell Isvaraya, you close your eyes and dream and your spirit is at peace."," Patchouli, Indian plum tree, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Inspiratrice Eau de Parfum,Divine," L'Inspiratrice, the new offering from the very elegant Divine collection of scents, is a supremely sensual fragrance that displays the refined, classic quality, which we consider to be Divine's trademark in perfume. The dark-red, honeyed warmth of the roses, enhanced by the sweet creaminess of ylang-ylang, vanilla and tonka bean, is combined with the dry and at the same time almost-gourmand earthiness of patchouli and the greenness of vetiver. A delicate sparkle, added to the composition by bergamot and peony, is utterly charming. L'Inspiratrice is bound to please even the most sophisticated of seductresses. Very chic. Truly Divine."," Rose, ylang-ylang, vanilla, tonka bean, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
All That Matters Eau de Parfum,Anamor," A subtle and elegant skin scent.  Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive – therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling. Discreetly seductive."," musk, sandalwood, lily of the valley",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mazzolari Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's signature scent is a rich, lush, wood-filled brew guaranteed to cause mass swooning.  It oozes class and beauty, a deeply green, woody fragrance softened by citrus and warmed by sandalwood.  Vetiver and cedar offer majestic backbones to this remarkable brew, and we can't think of anything better than curling up next to someone wearing this, a roaring fire, a glass of cognac and a sky full of stars. Dizzyingly seductive, romantic and deep."," Sandalwood, vetiver, spices and subtle citrus and green notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lui Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Potent and virile, Lui is the fragrance of a refined man with a wild streak a mile wide.  Rich with patchouli, vetiver and leather, this is a complex and unguarded scent, completely comfortable on the skin yet smokin' hot underneath.  Hints of sandalwood tame the wild animal, while a dark amber and rich musk enhance the raw sensuality of Lui.  Raw and elegant at the same time, Lui is an uninhibited fragrance for a man who likes to keep everyone guessing...and just a little on the edge."," Sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, ambergris, vetiver, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Alessandro Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Bitter almond, sweet honey and a soft powdery notes give Alessandro a dreamy, rich quality that zips you away to a bedroom filled with satin sheets, candles and exotic candies.  Almond and honey are the initial temptresses, beguiling your nose with their sweet charms. As the golden almond scent softens, it develops a lovely powdered almond feel...gentle and embracing.  At the base is a vanilla-like warmth with a kiss of sophistication.  Elegant, a bit dry, and utterly captivating, Alessandro is considered by many to be their 'holy grail' of fragrances."," almond, honey, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's Musk opens with a hint of barely-there spice before giving way to the carefree, light white musk in its heart and soul. As it warms with your skin, it soon reveals its fluffy, sweet nature, wrapping you in a cloud of puffy softness, sweet seduction and delicate guile. A standout among other clean musks, this one lasts forever, softening ever so gently.  It's the perfume equivalent of a soft cashmere sweater. Pure, white and just a touch of mystery."," light musc, subtle spice notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Eau de Toilette,Mazzolari," In a word: majestic. Mazzolari's Patchouli is smooth, earthy, deeply sweet and spicy all at once, but with absolutely none of the strident notes sometimes attributed to its main note. Rich, deep amber is woven throughout this masterpiece, which we think should just be labelled“aphrodisiac in a bottle.”  Not for fans of light or breezy scents, Patchouli is a smouldering, exotic animal, and a definite ”˜must-try' for sensualists (men or women) who revel in its dark and oh-so-dangerous depths."," Indonesian patchouli, spices, hints of amber, honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'ame Soeur Eau de Parfum,Divine," Named after the most intense and beautiful of encounters, L'Ã¢me SÅ“ur (”œSoulmate”) is an homage to the meeting of kindred spirits.  This fragrance epitomizes a harmony beyond time, an eternal marriage of noble flowers and aldehydes.  Jasmin, otto of Bulgarian rose and ylang from the Comoro Islands are decadent, elegant florals that, when combined with ambergris, form a union of timeless beauty.  Naturally seamless and filled with innate sensuality, L'Ã¢me SÅ“ur is modern example of ancient French perfumery at its most alluring."," jasmine, otto of Bulgarian rose, ylang, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Douceur de Vanille Eau de Parfum,Les Nereides," The softest, milkiest vanilla we've ever found. This evokes the pure, delicate sweetness of the icy crystals on top of homemade ice cream.   Incomparable bourbon vanilla is caressed with almond and cocoa and freshened with white rose. Opening with a burst of innocence and powder, Douceur de Vanille mellows into a gentle, creamy skin scent that seems more like a delectable aura than a perfume – as if you just happen to have naturally delicious skin. The perfect warm weather vanilla. Heavenly."," bourbon vanilla, almond, cocoa, white rose, star aniseed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opoponax Eau de Parfum,Les Nereides," Intensely resinous. Deeply sweet. Luxuriously warm. Opoponax smells like a cello sounds. A regal blend of sandalwood, amber, vanilla and, of course, opoponax, this is a profoundly sensuous scent.   You want to let yourself sink into it – to be warmed by the hazy molten gold of late afternoon sun streaming through the window, to feel the glide of heavy satin across bare skin and to let your thoughts drift. Mesmerizing."," opoponax (sweet myrrh), amber, vanilla, sandalwood, benzoin, citrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Precieux Eau de Parfum,Les Nereides," The soothing scent of rich, clean earth – unsullied by industry, freshened by rain. This is the loamy soil of an enchanted hillside at dusk as you lay in the grass and watch the clouds turn periwinkle. The opening is very intense, but give it a moment and the trademark gentle touch of Les NÃ©rÃ©ides becomes apparent. The patchouli retains its earthiness, but becomes soft and deep, melding with layers of pillowy vanilla and smooth musk to create a dreamy landscape. Bewitching."," Sweet orange, Green notes, Balsam, Scots Pine, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Vanilla, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11806.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Gardenia Perfume Oil,Michele Bergman," Like floating in and out of a dream. The blossom may be snow-blind white, but there is something deeply mysterious in the soul of gardenia and this silken oil blend captures it. Initially intense, Black Gardenia softens and becomes exquisitely fresh as it warms on your skin.  The beguiling heady sweetness of the beloved flower is rendered with a haunting delicacy and touched with the barest whisper of dark intentions.  Like the lilt of the sirens song or the fragile glow of a will o' the wisp, this fragrance reminds us that something extremely beautiful can also be extremely dangerous.",floral,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Divine Eau de Parfum,Divine," When we heard there was a cult fragrance named Divine, we had our doubts.  It might be very nice, maybe even lovely, but seriously... divine?  That's a bit presumptuous, isn't it?  Then we tried it and all skepticism vanished.  Divine is indeed divine.  We can't think of a better way to describe it.  The first whiff is very strong, very French, very opera and pearls.  Classic and rather formal. As it warms up, it becomes downright swanky-- still sophisticated, but drenched in the glamour of a bygone era:  Black Givenchy dresses, long cigarette holders and serious diamonds. Sipping ice-cold martinis with Frank and Dino on a red leather banquette at the Sands.  And just then, best of all, there is the amazing and complex drydown, balancing soft peach and superbly fresh flowers with a deep base of oak moss, vanilla, musk and spice. Achingly beautiful, impossible to forget. Not a scent for those who prefer their scents girlish and sugary or simple and unobtrusive. This is for confident, complicated women who are prepared to dazzle. Stunning. Breathtaking. And yes, we'll say it one more time-- simply divine."," peach, coriander, gardenia, Indian tuberose, May rose, oak moss, musk, vanilla, spice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Infante Eau de Parfum,Divine," A charming, creamy pink nosegay of sweet peony and ethereal jasmine with a refreshing touch of ivy for greenery. These delicate flowers are cradled in a sensuous base of vanilla, musk and tonka bean and the result is a warm, soft floral with lasting power. Playful, vivacious and sweet, this is a bonbon of a fragrance that's wonderful day or night. Light enough to suit a princess, but with a luxuriousness that befits a future queen. Deliciously pretty."," Chinese jasmine, peony, blackcurrant leaves, ivy, ambergris, vanilla, musk, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 05 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Cashmeran, the sole fragrant component in Molecule 05, has an unusually complex character for a single molecule. It combines a cocooning, musky softness with dry, aromatic woodiness, as well as a sweet and resinous note reminiscent of pine. Since its creation by IFF in the late 1970s, it's been the backbone of hit fragrances across the spectrum, with its sensuous versatility enhancing everything from fruity gourmands to boldly spicy orientals to musky skin scents. Indeed, it's almost hard to believe that Molecule 05, with its hypnotic radiance, is made of just a single aromachemical. And yet that's exactly what it is. Projecting confidently from the skin, Molecule 05 might be the most mesmerizing Molecule edition yet. Every aspect of cashmeran- the warmth, the depth, the sweetness, the resin- projects confidently from the skin, creating a beguiling aura in the beloved style of previous Molecule releases.

Escentric 05 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," ""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza SchoenCashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees. Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules."," Fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30859.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Arborist Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," Arborist is an ode to enchanting woodlands, the likes of which are found across the brand's native Scotland. Be warned, Arborist is not just lumber. It is an imagined day-in-the-life of a Virideer (the keeper of the grass and green wood in the forest).Arborist possesses an overwhelming and spirited opening mellowing into sun-bleached woods, malted cereals and worked-skin. A symphony of nature untamed. The core structure of Arborist is redolent of many great Scots timbers; their leaves, flowers, fruits, roots and soil being the quintessential portrait of the forest.Arborist presents a unique blend of raw flowers, botanicals, resin sap, underwood and surprising forest fruits. Resolutely sylvan and intriguingly multifaceted with more than a hint of human skin, oily tool and distilling elixirs haunting from afar."," Quince, Honey, Saffron, Osmanthus Absolute, Magnolia, Burdock, Papyrus, Mugwort, Rose Absolute, Tuberose, Myrrh Absolute, Spruce Resin, Douglas Fir, Labdanum, Jatamansi, Malt, Lichen",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Capitale Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," When a brand as synonymous with niche fragrance as Diptyque decides to create a scent celebrating the city of Paris,  the possibilities are almost overwhelming. What kind of scent could possibly capture the entirety of the rich,  multi-textured relationship between The City of Lights and the house of Diptyque? But of course,  there actually is a perfect answer- the chypre,  iconic amongst perfume styles,  a legendary accord with a thousand facets. But with the classic chypre so instantly identifiable- bergamot,  rose,  jasmine,  patchouli,  oakmoss- it's incumbent on any re-interpretation to bring something new and unique to the proceedings. Thus,  Eau Capitale is a chypre both respectful of tradition,  and yet uniquely and romantically modern- a dynamic new study of balance and contrast featuring a fresh yet timeless take on the beloved style. It still boats a lively citrus opening,  but with a twist- an especially green ""vert de bergamote"" of pronounced energy,  paired with a burst of pink peppercorn,  unique to the chypre style,  which gives a cool,  sparkling opening of notable modernity. The heart has a classic rose presence,  but utilizing three distinctive expressions of Damascene rose: an essence,  an absolute,  and a concentrate,  for a truly multifaceted and complex floral experience. And finally,  in place of the traditional oakmoss base,  a patchouli ""coeur, "" a fractional extract with a brighter character than traditional patchouli,  which closes us on an invigorating and modern high. Bright,  fresh,  romantic,  and nuanced,  Eau Capitale is a dynamic new chypre that proves that there's still ample life left in the classics- a fitting tribute to Paris if ever there was one."," Bergamot, pink pepper, rose essence, rose absolute, rose concentrate, patchouli coeur",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere L'Aube Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Boy, Manuel Cross wasn't messing around when he made FougÃ¨re L'Aube. Modelled after the first fougÃ¨re ever to be made, the original FougÃ¨re Royale by Houbigant, FougÃ¨re L'Aube heralds a triumphant return to the unapologetically masculine roots of the fougÃ¨re concept – the fresh, bitter aroma created by the marriage of lavender, oakmoss, and labdanum, given aromatic interest by way of minty geranium leaf and the sting of camphor.FougÃ¨re L'Aube is much more than a simple re-tread using great raw materials and real oakmoss, however. True to its name – which means ”˜fougÃ¨re of the dawn' – this scent opens with a burst of sparkling lemon and lavender, for a sunny ”˜garrigue' effect that's much brighter than the traditional fougÃ¨re opening led by bergamot. The bitter green galbanum and dry hay soon move in to darken the foresty shadows, though, and with the cool rosy-minty sting of geranium in the background, the oft-cited reference to the scent of ferns (fougÃ¨re meaning ”˜fern' in French) for once makes perfect sense. This is really old school, masculine canon – strictly for lovers of classic fougÃ¨res like Azzaro Pour Homme, Brut, and crisp green scents such as Green Irish Tweed."," lavender, oakmoss, geranium, citrus, hay, galbanum, costus, musk, sandalwood, camphor, amber, Moroccan rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Medie Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," MÃ©die is a symphony of citrus: the perfume's roots evoke the Antiquity and the kingdom of Alexander the Great, under which the province of MÃ©die abounded with rare citruses. An oasis of freshness, MÃ©die encapsulates the very heart of the fruit where citrus, spices and aromatic notes blend. In addition, bright green scents are combined with clear amber and woody notes, warmed up by a touch of incense. Composed like a citrus fragrance with an aromatic finish, MÃ©die leaves a vibrant bitterness in the air."," Grapefruit, Green mandarin, Sambac jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/559081.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Borneo Oud Pure Oud Oil,Fragrance du Bois," While superior quality oud shines through in any blend of ingredients,  a truly extraordinary specimen is like a single-malt or an outstanding varietal in that it really ought to be experienced on its own. Borneo Oud is a pure oud oil,  organically and sustainably sourced from Southeast Asia and aged over 4 years,  distilled into a sprayable oil that showcases the depth and sophistication of this rarified oud- spicy and rich,  yet vibrant and green. It's substantial enough to wear beautifully on its own,  but also the perfect oud to layer,  with a versatile drydown that balances animalic warmth and invigorating freshness. A true example of Fragrance du Bois' brand ethos of ""luxury with a conscience, "" this exquisite,  sustainably organic oud is a must have for all oud aficionados.", 100% pure oud,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre Azural Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," If you've long thought of the chypre category as dark and mysterious, think again. Chypre Azural is as juicy and fresh as the Sicilian Tarocco orange at its heart. Typically a contrast between fresh top notes and a mossy accord, that characteristic contrast can go in many directions, and in Chypre Azural it tips toward aromatic and bright, with patchouli grounding it in that family.An intriguing tarragon note snakes its aromatic way around a subdued rose and prominent orange, drying down to a skin scent with substance thanks to an authentic ambergris tincture, which adds body, roundness, and a touch of shadow to its sunny nature. Unlike many citrus-forward scents that seem to disappear as soon as you spray them on, Chypre Azural sticks around, swirling and evolving on skin until it and you become one."," Sicilian Tarocco orange oil, Egyptian centifolia rose absolute grand cru, Indonesian patchouli, Ambergris tincture, Tarragon from the Alps",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau des Sacres,Reims Parfums," L'Eau des Sacres executes its leap between its cool-toned, aromatic opening and its warm, golden drydown so effortlessly that it feels like watching the prima ballerina at the Paris Opera performing a piquÃ© turn for you alone. Opening in a cloud of peppery violet-and-lavender brightness, the scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious, like wandering into a small, rustic French church at Easter and inhaling the scent of flowers and herbs being placed over nubbins of waxy, lemony frankincense. Wafts of honeyed orange blossom add to the spring-like delicacy and brightness.It's in the basenotes that things take a seriously sensual tone. Dropping the aromatic herbs and petals of its opening, the scent dips us backwards into a warm bath of buttery, almond-inflected tonka bean, bolstered with a gorgeous ”˜buerre noisette' sandalwood. Lovers of Tonka ImpÃ©riale will rejoice in this drydown – similarly warm and comforting as the Guerlain, L'Eau des Sacres is perhaps even more natural-smelling and durable. A touch of ambergris adds an agreeably salty-fresh bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. We think that that L'Eau des Sacres' ”˜a little from column A, a little from column B' approach creates the perfect all-season bridge between the freshness of aromatic spring florals and the buttery winter weight of tonka-fied amber."," Pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Awake Eau de Parfum,Akro," The opening jolts you awake, like a loved one passing a freshly brewed espresso in front of your nose as you begin to nod off. Hot, black, intense roasted bean with the burnt edge of wood crackling in the grate. The green bite of cardamom giving it a tart edge. Awake's darkness is tantalizingly profound, but the perfumer has thoughtfully slipped a nugget of toasted hazelnut in with the coffee to buffer it from any sharpness or acridity. Awake manages that compromise between sharp and sweet so smoothly that you begin to imagine it's easy – but make no mistake, it is the experienced hand of Cresp that keeps the scent on an even keel. The dance of coffee, hazelnut, and toasted wood ebbs and flows through the scent like a steady pulse, before sweetening slightly, finishing out in a remarkably textured rendition of those crunchy coffee candies in the checkout aisle of Italian grocery stores. Not sweet, not particularly gourmand, and yet, also not bitter or grainy in that way that coffee scents can be, Awake is the happy medium of coffee scents."," Balkans Santos Coffee, Green Cardamom, Italian Lemon, Haitian Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
B683 Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois,"“I like the raw and yet so chic aspect of this perfume: a very refined and wild fragrance.” – Quentin Bisch, perfumerB683 is a result of the meeting of two young designers. One is a couturier, the other a perfumer. Their childhood memories brought them together. Remembering captivating smells; of the leather from an elegant attachÃ© case or an immaculate desk blotter; of the distinct smells of wood during the regular gathering of fuel to warm the family home. The artistic skills of the former and the olfactory talent of the latter together sparked a magical and pleasant fragrance with its notes of spices, leather and wood. What We Think An oh-so-wearable leather scent that feels smoothly sophisticated but dynamically modern- the spice and woods add tone and energy without sacrificing elegance."," Black Pepper, Saffron, Chili Pepper, Nutmeg, Violet Leaf, Amber, Cistus Absolute, Musk, Patchouli, Santal Wood, Oakmoss, Ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ramune (Japanese Soda) Eau de Parfum,J-Scent," The nostalgic scent reminds you of the excitement when you pop open a ramune bottle sealed with a marble stopper at a summer festival.The refreshing scent of ramune that cools your body on a hot summer night. This perfume starts with the clear notes of lemon, aldehyde and mint, then brings the gentle sweet notes of rose, lily of the valley and magnolia, eventually leaving behind the notes of musk and vanilla, relaxing the senses. This scent will evoke summer memories, lighting your heart with nostalgic dreamy summer lanterns. What We Think The distinctly bubblegummy flavor of Ramune comes through with evocative clarity- minty, fruity, fresh, and fun."," Spearmint, Peppermint, Lemont Squash, Raspberry, Bergamot, Aldehyde, Rose, Muguet, Water Lily, Magnolia, Hyacinth, Musk, Amber, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fille en Aiguilles Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," The name means“Girls in Needles” – and pine needles at that, rather than chic“talons aiguilles” (stiletto heels)... But boys can roll around in them too: this is a decidedly non-gendered, atmospheric scent.Pine essence is a risky bet in perfumery: its medicinal, turpentine fumes conjure household disinfectants or cough drops and are particularly hard to tame. Serge Lutens, never one to shirk a challenge, opted for playing them up rather than tamping them down: the result is uncharacteristically raw, almost minimalist. In Filles en Aiguilles, the powerful resinous smell of pine is compounded by the camphor blast of vetiver and a wisp of gunpowder incense. Fruity fir balsam and the trademark Lutens candied fruit notes sweeten the blend without playing down its dark green radiance. A searing afternoon in Mediterranean pine groves or a Californian forest; a Buddhist temple or Christmas morning; the hale aroma of a lumber yard; a painter's studio strewn with turpentine-soaked rags...  Whatever memories Filles en Aiguilles conjures, this poignantly evocative, meditative potion will somehow feel healing. You'll need it this winter. What We Think The sweet aromatic freshness of pine sap and candied fruit makes this a joyfully nostalgic autumn fragrance."," Pine needles, vetiver, sugary sap, laurel, fir balsam, frankincense, candied fruit and spice.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Purple Haze Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""The fragrance Purple Haze embraces the hippie movement and counterculture just like John and Yoko's bed-ins in Amsterdam and Montreal. Purple Haze is about the legendary Keenak who I met in Bahama Village, Key West. Guitar on his back, snakeskin boots, skinny jeans, and long hair. A sense of Woodstock. It is a tribute to creativity, freedom, and indulgence."" -Johan Bergelin Since when did we all get so scared of smelling like a hippie? Unlike many of its patchouli-based contemporaries in niche fragrance, Purple Haze doesn't run away from the raw, earthy, evocative power of this misunderstood material. Instead, it delivers the wearer a heady, intoxicating, psychedelic fougere that mixes intensely fresh aromatic notes like cypress, cannabis, and thyme with a rich patchouli-woods-vanilla base for an extremely groovy trip back in time. Deep, powerful, quirky and captivating, Purple Haze is a scent unafraid to embrace its inner love child."," Italian Bergamot, Corsican Cypress, Cannabis Accord, Ranesara, Ciste, Palmarosa, Thyme, Gurjum, Violet Leaf, Vanilla, Patchouli, Black Pepper, White Musk, Dry Woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peau de Peche Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," This begins with a lovely, delicate and true white peach. Not a peach drenched in syrup or baked in a pie, but newly picked from the tree, with that fragile, unforgettable scent of fresh peach skin. An elegant peach, wrapped in a mist of soft sandalwood and powdery orris. Peau de Peche has an elusive quality, like chasing a will-o'-the-wisp than leads you ever further into an enchanted forest.

Lost Cherry Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Lost Cherry is a contrasting scent that reveals a tempting dichotomy of playful, candy-like gleam on the outside and luscious flesh on the inside. Innocence intersects indulgence with an opening the captures the classic perfection of the exotic cherry fruit. Black cherry's ripe flesh dripping in cherry liqueur glistens with a teasing touch of bitter almond. The heart bursts forth in cherry waves of sweet and tart. Griotte syrup expresses the textured maceration of voluptuous fruits while breathtaking florals of Turkish rose and jasmine sambac penetrate the senses and soul. Peru balsam and roasted tonka at the drydown suggest a new portrait of an iconic symbol. When blended with an unexpected mÃ©lange of sandalwood, vetiver and cedar, the finish reaches fantasy-inspiring levels of insatiability. What We Think A sweet, boozy-rich cherry with a smooth tonka drydown- a grown-up almond gourmand scent with a sexy edge."," black cherry accord, bitter almond, griotte syrup, rose absolute OrpurÂ®, Peru balsam, roasted tonka Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Lost Cherry by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Over the Chocolate Shop Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Once upon a time, 4160 Tuesdays magic-maker Sarah McCartney was inspired to create a chocolate scent by her friend's apartment, which was serendipitously perched atop a chocolate shop. The scent was everything a chocolate shop scent should be- rich, creamy, and delectable- but this was before Sarah had learned the ins and outs of perfume production, so the recipe went back in a drawer. Years later, it has been resurrected, and we're all the richer for it. Simply put, if you've been searching for the scent of real chocolate- not cookies, not cake, but a pure, decadent chocolate truffle- Over the Chocolate Shop may just be your holy grail. Every simple, mouthwatering ingredient- sumptuous cocoa butter, creamy vanilla, caramelized praline, a perfect sprinkle of coffee- blends seamlessly into a divine confection, a picture-perfect bonbon plucked from the window of a fairytale chocolatier, a single bite you'll remember for the rest of your life. Those of us who truly love chocolate scents are always on the hunt for the next great one. We're pleased to announce that it's arrived."," Praline, cocoa butter, coffee, hazelnut, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eleventh Hour Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," It seems funny to say this, but Eleventh Hour is not the first fragrance we've carried based on the end of the world. It is, however, still quite a novelty- the first fragrance ever to feature an astonishing new note- Ban Timmur, a Nepalese plant related to Szechwan pepper, known for both intense, almost anesthetic spice but also unusually bright, citrussy tones. Don't worry if it's hard to imagine- the utterly unique note is the very first thing you'll smell on your initial spray, a combination of juicy citrus and sweet, spicy, clovelike tones for a note both thrillingly novel, but also possessed of a certain familiar holiday-spice styled comfort. The heart it leads into is every bit as original- spicy, earthy carrot seed set against sweetly seductive rum and juicy, wild fig. Warm, smooth tonka dominates the drydown, but the real wonder of 11th Hour is the pervasiveness of the Ban Timmur, lending the fragrance the sweet, rich spiciness of an opulent oriental scent, but with a distinctively fresh energy that lasts into the drydown. According to Byredo, featuring an ingredient from the imposing Nepalese highlands is a statement on the kind of inhospitable places humanity may eventually be forced to survive as ocean levels rise. Heavier stuff than a perfume description can necessarily grapple with, to be sure, but at least now we know that when the end of the world arrives, we're going to be smelling great, really, really, great."," Ban timmur pepper, bergamot, carrot seed, rum, wild fig, tonka bean, cashmere woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sabbia Bianca Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Concentrated at a whopping 43% of pure perfume oil and playing host to some of the world's most exquisite natural floral absolutes, Sabbia Bianca is the Rolls Royce of the Big White Floral genre. The composition is uncluttered, with only four listed notes. That's because when you go to the trouble of sourcing the best and most expensive tuberose, ylang, and tiare, you want their beauty to be able to shine uninterrupted. Sabbia Bianca is the perfect fantasy of a tropical island in a bottle, complete with sugar-white sand, crystalline azure waters, and gently-swaying palm trees. Immediately upon application, you are plunged into a pool of lush, inviting coconut milk, its surface dotted with waxy tiare petals. The buttery tuberose and gardenia are huge, and so heavily narcotic that you feel as if you've sipped on moonshine made from tropical flowers. Although Sabbia Bianca is almost obscenely rich, flickers of a woody freshness here and there hold the perfume back from excessive sweetness - perhaps the banana leaf nuance in the ylang or the greenness of the violet. That said, keep in mind that just one drop of this super concentrated elixir is enough to radiate heady tropical warmth all day long. Our take on Sabbia Bianca is this: sometimes you have to go all out to experience perfection in a genre. And for us, Sabbia Bianca is worth the investment."," tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, tiare",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33948.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sundrunk Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors," ""Woozy and warm from the sun, we shared an orange pop and watched the surfers' last lines of the day.""Amy ObisboBlindingly bright, captivatingly crisp, Sundrunk explodes onto the palate with electric notes of citrus spiked with a vibrantly herbaceous sheen. It's the rich, dizzy, warm-to-your-fingertips feeling of an afternoon running with friends in the blinding brightness, sharing toasts to life and youth and creativity, and collapsing in a tired, satisfied heap as the afternoon crawls by. With a delicious, thirst-quenching combination of shimmering orange, smooth florals and tantalizingly tart rhubarb, one sniff is enough to soothe, energize, and delight, all at once. Sundrunk's extraordinary freshness may not last forever- but when you're under its spell, it sure feels like it will."," Neroli, rhubarb, honeysuckle, rose water, orange zest, first kiss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Time Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," What a beautiful, refreshing tea scent! Fans of tea scents know that a good one is difficult to find; well, House of Oud's The Time is a good one. The opening of bergamot, chamomile, and wormwood note creates a superb green tea impression, uniquely fresh and bitter, but with a nutty hay-like undertone. Slowly, other types of tea notes start to feed into the scent, helping to round out the picture and fill in the gaps. Oolong tea adds a milkiness that softens the astringency of the green tea, rendering it cloudy, while a black tea note lends a smoky leathery nuance. Together, the combination of the different teas gives the scent a subtle“roasted” undertone.   There's a series of contrasts at play here that works very well. The Time smells both fresh and comforting, milky and smoky, which all adds up to a sort of green-on-cream effect. The nubuck suede notes in the base tie it all together for an experience that feels like drinking a cup of green tea in an upmarket equestrian store, surrounded by the complex aromas of saddle leather, tea leaves, and even the polite suggestion of hay. We're confident that fans of refined leather-tea fragrances such as Memo's Eau de Memo and Hermes' Osmanthe Yunnan will find a new love in The Time."," Bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanilla Cake Eau de Parfum,Montale," Could there ever be an aroma more blissful than removing a freshly-baked cake from the oven? The feeling of accomplishment for a job well done, the mouthwatering, sweet, warm smell that fills the room, the anticipation of that perfect first bite- it's heaven on earth. With Vanilla Cake, Montale invites you to enjoy that wondrous feeling every single day. This gourmand and bewitching fragrance recipe calls for blending milk, grilled almonds, warm caramel and vanilla for the ultimate meringue silllage. Creamy, sweet, toasty and rich, this is a perfect gourmand scent, the kind to leave a trail of admirers salivating. Utterly delicious."," Almond powder, butter cream, milky mousse, caramel, yogurt cake, meringue, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freeway Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Freeway is the story that jumped, fully formed, into Sarah McCartney's mind when she visited Scent Bar one hot summer's day and stepped out onto the hot asphalt outside. A friend was just driving away, and the smell of his Maserati's exhaust mixed with the scent of the orange blossom in the air and the tang of hot, melting asphalt...Sarah was inspired then and there to create an urban take on orange blossom exclusively for Luckyscent, to help celebrate our 15th anniversary. The idea was to take the fresh, sugary brightness of orange blossom and sully it with a host of gritty, determinedly non-floral smells from an urban environment, making for a scent with a sexy kick in its tail: think flowers crushed under a rubber-soled sneaker. Sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil here for its plummy citrus aroma but also for its fuel-like facet; the result is sweet orange blossom water spilled on hot tar. For such a popular note, orange blossom is easy to get wrong – too sweet and it's juvenile, too honeyed and it can turn sleazy. Freeway does orange blossom right, pitched exactly halfway between bright and dark. Dry woods, tobacco, and grassy cannabis notes dry out the tarry orange blossom until it smells more like old paper and less like a flower. A light, foamy vanilla froths around the dry, papery notes for a result that smells like eating a thimbleful of insanely rich, perfumery orange blossom gelato in an antique book store. Urban and urbane, Freeway is the scent of L.A.'s future, when, as Sarah says,“all cars are solar powered and the Freeways have cycle lanes, orange groves, jasmine hedgerows, and picnic areas.”"," Mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64623.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
20 Mars 2022 Eau de Parfum,Rundholz Parfums," What does the future smell like? Obviously, we'll have to wait to know for sure, but with 20MARS2022, Rundholz for the first time explores the scent of a date not yet reached- and they're reaching for the stars. Opening with an intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed with a bouquet of refined gourmand spice, delicately sweetened with a touch of fruit and a rich, but restrained floral heart. The true star, as with all Rundholz scents, is the deep, balsamic incense that emerges in the heart, rich and resinous, made lightly smoky with a touch of crÃ¨me brulee vanilla and haylike Tonka bean, given a sensual animalic growl with civet and castoreum.  Overall, the effect is enveloping, the kind of deep, wondrous incense scent where each sniff reveals a new facet. Sure, we know the ""Mars"" in 20Mars2022 refers to the month, and not the planet. But with a scent this out of this world, you'll have to forgive us for not always remembering that."," Pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, Tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Amourette Roland Mouret Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," ""An unforgettable love affair, "" Une Amourette is the result of a portentious conversation between Etat Libre d'Orange and groundbreaking fashion designer Roland Mouret. Every bit as iconoclastic in the world of design as ELDO is for French fragrance,  Mouret's work demonstrate a preternatural eye for sensuality,  flow and innovation,  a gift for draping fabric over skin in the same way that Etienne de Swardt's fragrances drape the skin. So,  of course,  a collaboration was inevitable- but what a collaboration this is. Soft and romantic,  yet striking and avant-garde,  Une Amourette is a beautifully woodsy iris that wears like the most flattering couture you can imagine. It starts with the iris note- sharp but not stark,  with just the right amount of floral lushness to allow the vanilla-tinged akigala wood to slowly develop underneath,  adding a purringly seductive,  subtly muscular form to the flowing silhouette of the scent. As it dries,  the gentle earthiness of the iris further gives shape to the body beneath,  evoking a softer-but still distinctive- carnality that has us positively swooning. Some partnerships are so obvious you wonder why they've taken so long to manifest,  but in the case of Une Amourette,  we think we know the answer- they wanted to keep us waiting."," Iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47750.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Cri De La Lumiere Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Inspired by the light towards which all beings reach out whether entering or leaving this world, Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re employs a sparse framework of just three notes: ambrette, iris, and rose. But for all its elegant minimalism, this is a scent with plenty to say. Ambrette, with its tart nuances of green apple, pear, and grappa, is first to announce its presence, bathing the scent in a halo of crystalline light. The opening pitches high, with an almost citrusy sparkle. The iris note, at first rooty and then bready, moves in to flesh out the structure, like a length of suede draped over a metal chair. Comparisons between this perfume and another ambrette-iris composition, Chanel No. 18, are natural – but Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re is far brighter and drier affair, with a delicate sourness absent from the Chanel. As silvery as a glass of white vermouth, the scent gains a blush in its cheeks thanks to the late addition of rose. The ambrette wraps around the rose and iris, bedding them down in a soapy muskiness that feels both clean and sensual. The texture of this scent is dappled; in turns sheer and cloudy, bright and shaded, like a glass of Pastis into which a drop of water has just been stirred. Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re is a fragrance with noble lineage: aristocratic, haughty, and a little mysterious."," Ambrette, rose, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wulong Cha Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Wulong ChÃ¡ is a vibrant, woody fig tea with a refreshing twist of citrus to give it sparkle. It opens with an Earl Grey type of freshness, with black tea leaves oily with bergamot, orange, and an exotic, fruity lift that is not immediately identifiable (that would be the litchi). But the heart is pure Oolong: a smoky tea full of delicate, nutty roasted flavors, and a slight but noticeable milkiness. The introduction of the fig note in the heart adds to this impression of milkiness; it smells beautifully like a freshly snapped fig leaf, green and oozing with fig sap.What a lovely balance of tannins, fruit, and milk this is. We like Wulong ChÃ¡ because it has both the clean, fresh transparency we've come to expect from great tea fragrances, but also a sweet, figgy milkiness that rounds off any sharp corners. In the later stages, a gauzy white musk, as soft as a pillow and spiced gently with nutmeg, wraps everything up in a light, silky embrace. Wulong ChÃ¡ is a refreshing wear, especially in summer, but it's also insanely soothing. Strictly to be worn with a white linen shirt and a mint julep in hand."," Bergamot, orange, lychee, mandarin, oolong tea, nutmeg, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77417.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lily Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Lily of the valley takes a trip to the land of green (and likes it!). An absolutely gorgeous combination of the much-loved lily and freesia flowers, together with the extremely smooth notes of green syringe (lilac leaves) and dog rose buds, Lily is never drowned in grassy or herbaceous green. Instead, the subtle leaf notes merely round out the fragrance, imparting a fresh (and definitely tart) crispness to the languid florals. Stimulating and alive, Lily will make you throw your preconceived notions of what a floral fragrance is out the door. A must-try for both floral and non-floral lovers!"," Lily of the valley, freesia, green syringa, dog rose buds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Guimauve de Noel Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Selected by Denyse Beaulieu to feature in her top 10 of 2016 for Grain de Musc, Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a pillowy marshmallow scent flavored with orange flower water and dusted in enough powdered sugar to make your teeth ache. But while it reminds us most pleasurably of fougassette, a type of bread fragrant with orange flower water sold in every market in Provence, this is not at all a heavy, gluttonous fragrance. Rather, it is a tender puff of orange flower-scented air with the sparkle of sugar crystals. It has a very French character, reminiscent both of those little chouquettes eaten by French schoolchildren at snack time, as well as the milky vapors of their evening baths, orange flower water sprinkled liberally into the water by Maman. Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a frothy, tender delight that is just perfect for celebrating the innocence of youth and the joy of family life.

""Unburdened by title or propriety, "" as he is described,  Radcliff is a hard-partying,  fast-driving,  ever-libidinous rogue,  and his namesake fragrance packs an appropriate growl of rum-drenched,  deeply smoky tobacco,  given a touch of his illicit high society lineage with a deep streak of sweet,  spicy,  mouthwatering gingerbread. Radcliff is a rebel,  all right,  but not the kind to start a fight- more like the kind to sweet-talk you into the night of your life.... consequences be damned."," Rum, Tobacco, Ginger Bread",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Baraonda Extrait de Parfum,Nasomatto," A mysterious addition to the Nasomatto line, Baraonda comes with few clues attached. The name means“chaos” or“uproar” in Italian, but the fragrance itself is subtle and almost transparent. The nose of this fragrance warns us that it will evoke“a raw taste sensation”....but what we taste is both comforting and refined. Baraonda smells like the pleasures of fall, painted with a light hand. A tumbler of whiskey held up to catch the glow from an open fire. Delicate little glass bowls holding red berries, quince, and apples baked slowly until they fall apart. An old book, open on the lap, filling the air with the dry, papery scent of lignin. A hint of caramelized wood resin dancing around the edges of the room but never closing in. Baraonda takes the heavy oil paints of the boozy-gourmand genre and uses them to make a watercolor so exquisite that it will have you savoring its taste on your tongue long after you've worn it.","red berries, quince, apples, wood resin, whiskey, ",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Vetiver Moloko Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," To the initiated, Moloko, the futuristic cocktail in A Clockwork Orange, conjures all sorts of associations: futuristic mod fashion, milky whiteness, and a dangerous, intoxicating vitality. With Vetiver Moloko, Ex Nihilo capitalizes on that imagery, delivering a fragrance on the one hand earthy and spiky, on the other soft and milky, which combine for an addictive, slightly unnerving symphony of scents that evolve on the skin with fascinating effect.Vetiver Moloko opens with bright, lightly bitter bergamot and soft rose notes, revealing its dual nature straight from the beginning. In the heart, the tantalizing milk accord blurs the olfactory picture for a narcotizing effect, while woodsy cypress buzzes along the surface. Once the vetiver reveals itself, we realize just how potent this cocktail has been all along, while a drop of vanilla at the end re-balances. Whether you're out with the droogs or on the prowl for a chelloveck or devotchka, Vetiver Moloko is not to be missed."," Bergamot, Bulgarian rose, cypress, milk accord, vetiver, amyris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur Narcotique Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," While the Left Bank gets all the traditional credit for being Paris' arts and cultural center,  everyone knows that it's the Rive Droite,  with its bustle,  style and know-how,  where the new generation is coming to life. Fleur Narcotique,  an airy,  vibrantly juicy floral designed as Ex Nihilo's ""interpretation of the new Rive Droite woman, "" is both sophisticated and seductive,  indicative of the 21st century Paris,  where tradition and modernity walk thrillingly hand in hand. Fleur Narcotique opens with a vital and fruit-laden set of top notes,  with bright,  energetic bergamot embracing a burst of juicy peach and exotic,  fruity lychee.

Moon Bloom Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," Lush and elegant,  Moon Bloom is not just another tuberose fragrance - it's the gorgeous,  completely natural tuberose that makes us wonder why any fragrance wouldn't be. Demonstrating a complete mastery of natural materials,  Hiram Green has created a fragrance that captures all aspects of the flower known as the“mistress of the night, ” soft and creamy,  but also powerfully narcotic. Sparing no expense,  Green uses plentiful amounts of tuberose absolute,  blending it with a full-bodied,  lightly indolic jasmine absolute and a lusciously tropical ylang ylang. Notes of coconut and leafy greens give body and contrast,  while hints of tropical spices and resins up the spicy,  sexy factor without ever sacrificing the fragrance's raw beauty.

Relique d'Amour Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," The smell of an old chapel in a Cistercian abbey. Cold stone walls covered with damp moss. Waxed wood of altar and old pews ornate with carvings. Linseed oil in lamps. Incense and myrrh discernible in the air. But how fresh and spicy the smell of white royal lilies on this background! Relique d'Amour is a subtle floral scent with green accents of leaves and powdery touches of yellow pollen. The beam of light breaks through the stained glass and illuminates this olfactory tumult of feelings varying from exaltation to humility and back. The silence creates a sense of the divine call.Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Fresh Herbs, pine, powdery notes, white lily, pepper, oak, incense, myrrh, elemi, musk, moss, waxed wood, woody notes, pepper.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65219.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Palermo Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," In the ancient Mediterranean city of Palermo, the regional capital of Sicily, the orange trees that Berber and Moorish emirs planted long ago still grow. Their bergamot and bigarade fruits light up Byredo's Palermo, a scent as close to olfactory happiness as you can get, a perfume played in the highest, brightest keys.Palermo's citrus grove sits alongside a rose garden, its rose bushes greened up in spring with the smell of crushed orange tree leaves and sliced fruits: lemon, lime, grapefruit, and maybe even aromatic pomelo. In its opening, an effervescent freshness of citrus juice is layered with cut citrus rinds, their zest oils conveying a more intense richness, bitterness, and spice.During your walk in the garden, as the sun warms your skin, a warm musk rises up, slightly powdery, softening the bracing freshness of the hesperidic top notes of Palermo and helping the freshness to linger with the warmth. This is a unisex fragrance perfect for warmer months."," Sicilian bergamot, bigarade, fresh rose absolute, skin musk, ambrette flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sorriso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," A delicious and sophisticated gourmand scent built on the always-enticing combination of chocolate and orange. The bitter orange opening is bright and sharp and does not fade away, but melds beautifully with the intense and luscious chocolate note that dominates the blend.  The notes list bitter chocolate, but it does not have the aggressive bite of unsweetened baker's squares. Instead it reminds us of fine, European bittersweet cocoa powder – like Valrhona or Callebaut – rich and dark, with just a hint of sweetness. Dusted over fresh orange and velvety woods (and perhaps a creamy vanilla-tinged note, as well), this is a luxurious, grown-up cocoa with no marshmallows in sight. Sorriso is one of the most elegant chocolate scents we have ever encountered. It isn't sugary or buttery and it doesn't juxtapose the edible elements with surprising, jarring notes. It is smooth and balanced, earning its sophistication by embracing the bitter elements of chocolate, as well as the sweet, and by using soft, soothing wood as an anchor. Sorriso means smile and this fragrance will surely evoke many of them."," Bitter chocolate, bitter orange, exotic woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33938.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tam Dao - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," A familiar yet reinvented interpretation, with accentuated, enhanced major notes... the Eau de Parfum expresses itself with even more personality, audacity, intensity and tenacity. Here, with Tam Dao, the star ingredient, sandalwood from Mysore, is of exceptional quality. In the EDP version, Ginger, Tahiti lime, and the coconut accord emphasize the creamy smooth facet of Mysore sandalwood, resulting in a milky, woody creamy concoction."," Lime, Coriander, ginger, sandalwood, cedarwood, musc, vanilla, amber wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Duelle - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," A familiar yet reinvented interpretation, with accentuated, enhanced major notes... the Eau de Parfum expresses itself with even more personality, audacity, intensity and tenacity. Here, the star ingredient, Vanilla bourbon from Madagascar, is a richer, deeper interpretation of bourbon vanilla married with a vanilla pod infusion. And to top it all off, the intensity is made more powerful with incense and amber, resulting in a sensual, rounded vanilla with animalic and leather facets."," Pink peppercorn, juniper berry, cardamom, cypress, frankincense, calamus, Black ceylan tea, cistus, Bourbon vanilla, vanilla pod, vetyver, cypriol, ambroxin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483139.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Korrigan Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Korrigan is less harmless than it looks. This caramel wood is no perfume from childhood; it is a scent of intimacy, insidiously musky and irresistible on the skin of a desired being. It is the fragrance of the senses set free, to be shared or saved for intimate moments, when caresses follow on sweet whispers and bodies draw closer. It is an invitation to voluptuousness, to sensuous pleasures, and to fantasies of the most extravagant kind.Perfumer Thomas Fontaine first of all imagined a tree for Lubin, to be called“Caramel Wood”. Its sap would be sweet like English toffee, but with tangy accents of wild apple, juniper and saffron, to answer for some of its mystery. He wanted a note of leather yet appetising, smooth like a whisky cream liqueur, yet smoky, fragrant and slightly bitter like superb pure malt."," Juniper berry, saffron, cognac, Lavender, ambrette, whiskey, Cedar, oudh, leather, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31220.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois d'Ascese Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," A meditative swirl of serene incense, intensified by smoked wood. At first, this brings to mind a stark, secluded chapel and a life of plain and simple pleasures. But as it develops, notes of whiskey, tobacco and cinnamon begin to shimmer through the incense, and you start to think that perhaps these pleasures won't be quite so plain, after all. If you have ever enjoyed a fine Islay Scotch whiskey, such as Lagavulin or Laphroaig, you are familiar with the way the intricacies of smoke and moss add a complicated and enigmatic appeal – harsh and medicinal one moment, mesmerizing the next. The layers of smoked cade wood, oakmoss and whiskey have a similar effect here, as bracing jolts of smoke morph into the airy tranquility of incense, keeping us endlessly intrigued and hopelessly addicted.  A starkly elegant fragrance that puts us in a trance.All Naomi Goodsir Parfums include an atomizer spray."," tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, Somalian incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Philosykos - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time, now even stronger and more compelling.  This ode to the fig groves of Greece is still a very green fig – a fig just on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play – sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove – the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens. Many a superlative has been used to describe this fragrance over the years and it deserves every one. Outstanding."," Fig tree leaves, wood, white cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Jardin du Poete Eau de Toilette,Eau d'Italie," Eau d'Italie teams up again with Bertrand Duchaufour for this lyrical interpretation of an al fresco dinner in a Sicilian garden. Orange in every tone – tart, bitter, sweet – is livened up with grapefruit, whose raspy, slightly sulfurous facets are underlined with cassis and the minty buchu leaf; basil conjures the aromatic herbal garden. These green facets, as well as the rosy undertones of the grapefruit segue into the green, watery, rose-like cyclamen, a natural companion to lily of the valley and rose providing a rich, moist, floral counterpoint to the sparkle of citrus... Immortelle, moss and hay conjure the heat exhaled by vegetation as the sun sets after a warm summer day. Like its source of inspiration, the“Poet's Garden” manages to find a perfect balance between citrus, herbal, floral and wood notes; between the vitality of nature in the Mediterranean, and the harmonious, millennial Mediterranean culture."," Green orange, sweet orange, bitter orange, grapefruit, blackcurrant, petitgrain, buchu leaf, basil, angelica, cardamom, pink bay, cyclamen, lily of the valley, rose, moss, immortelle, cypress, hay, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Duelle - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Eau Duelle is a vibrant dash of cold spices - cardamom, pink peppercorn and saffron - and the intoxicating juniper essence hits new heights with fresh cypress and elemi aromatic tinges. Then the vanilla emerges triumphant against the light and dark backdrop.On the one hand, there is ethereal, epicurean and powdery Firnat vanilla, its enthralling sweetness exalted by paradisone - a Firmenich captive molecule akin to an infinitely pure hedione - and by white, sweet and enveloping musks.On the other, there is original and mysterious bourbon vanilla. It is slightly smoked and almost syrupy. Vetiver, African frankincense smoke, and animal and leathery twists from Asian cypriol purify it. A spice trail necessarily travels through places where unexpected exchanges occur.The gatecrashers here are black tea from Ceylon and the famous calamus reed, the tasty revealers that make the journey singular, memorable and priceless. Eau Duelle will delight anyone who dreams of breathing vanilla with a different tinge. It is neither languid nor docile: it is enthralling in an all-new way."," Cardamom, Asian cyprus, elemi, juniper, saffron, calamus, black tea, black African olibanum, amber, Firnat Vanilla, Bourbon Vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tilda Swinton Like This Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," With Like This, Etat Libre d'Orange pays homage to the intelligent and surreally beautiful actress Tilda Swinton. Etat's challenge was immediate: to create a fragrance that reflects Swinton's uncommon grace and talent. Like Swinton, the fragrance needed to be unusual yet welcoming, delicate yet strong, seductive without being distracting, and full of radiance. With Like This, they succeeded. Like This is unlike any other fragrance we've smelled, and yet it is as comfortable and warm as a summer afternoon in the Scottish hillside.The fragrance opens with a juicy hit of neroli and mandarin, and it is quickly balanced by the earthiness of pumpkin flesh, a note rarely found in perfume. A thread of exotic immortelle and powdered ginger add both sweetness and spice to the composition. But don't think Like This smells like the pantry”” a lush bouquet of rose, heliotrope, and green vetiver are the foundation on which the scent is built, and a hint of clean musk adds intimacy. Like This wears for hours, yet stays close to the skin. Like This follows Swinton's lead in breaking artistic convention. The only real way to understand either of them is to experience them."," Yellow mandarin, ginger, pumpkin accord, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, rose de Grasse, vetiver, heliotrope, and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nio Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff describes Nio as“A refreshing walk through the south Italian countryside, ” and they couldn't be more right. Wearing Nio,  we imagine strolling down a shady,  cypress-lined lane in the height of summer,  just before the sun sets. It's that special time between day and night,  the time the French refer to as the blue hour. A slight breeze lifts from a nearby ocean,  cooling the warm air and mingling with the fresh,  herbal scent of the trees and their woody bark. Soon night will fall and the crickets will begin to chirp. We're thinking of the chilled Campari and good company waiting at the villa just ahead. Nio opens with a mouthwatering blend of rich neroli and Calabrian bergamot before deepening into its resinous,  green heart. Hints of spice,  pepper,  and dry cedar enliven the composition,  and vetiver keeps Nio's refreshing fragrance grounded. Unlike many green,  earthy fragrances,  Nio doesn't fade into a vague woody shadow. Instead,  it retains its refined vivaciousness for hours and hours,  alternately showing its uplifting then mysterious aspects. Nio is the rare fragrance that is fresh without being jarring and elegant without being stuffy."," Neroli, Calabrian bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, green leaves, cedar, gaiac wood, Haitian vetiver, Indian patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Philosykos - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time. Philosykos is an ode to the fig groves of Greece. Created by Olivia Giacobetti, this is a very green fig – a fig on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play – sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove – the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens.

Jubilation XXV Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Unabashedly opulent. There is nothing minimal about this celebratory elixir and we couldn't be happier about that. Let's face it, sometimes more is more. Jubilation XXV features the prized frankincense of the Sultanate of Oman, but this is not a meditative, stone cathedral type of incense fragrance. This is a lavish bazaar, packed to the brim with all of the treasures of 1001 nights.  The silver frankincense weaves through burnished woods, luscious fruits and blood-warming spices. It teases the elusive rock rose and the ever-so-grand orchid and wraps itself around luxurious opoponax and amber. The opening is sweet and honeyed, with a hint of bitterness that reminds us of the aftertaste that lets you know when a fruity liqueur is going to pack a wallop. (Fans of Frapin 1270 may want to join us in enjoying this deep and satisfying fruity booziness). As the scent mellows, it becomes richer and the wood notes become prominent. In spite of the litany of intense and dark-sounding notes, this never becomes gothic or moody. The aura is warm and velvety and extremely content, like you are leaning against a great golden lion who is purring like a race car. This is designed for men, yet somewhere deep down inside we know there is no way the women of the world are going to let the guys keep something this fantastic all to themselves."," Frankincense, labdanum ciste, coriander, davana, blackberry, orange, gaicwood, rose, honey, bay, orchid, cinnamon, clove, celery seed, opoponox, patchouli, myrrh, musk, moss, atlas cedarwood, ambergris, oud, immortelle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Phtaloblue Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," While everyone loves the sparkling brightness of an aquatic scent, it's hard to deny that the vast majority of them are all a bit... repetitive. So when we say Phtaloblue, with its distinct and invigorating blend of herbaceous and woody aquatic accords, is a breath of fresh air, please understand that we mean that in every possible sense. We'd expect nothing less from one of the most uniquely creative perfumers we know. Phtaloblue explodes off the skin with a delightfully bracing burst of oceanic freshness, salt water mingled with vibrant citrus, but also a distinctive and captivating note of sweet, aromatic fennel that instantly imparts a warm, sensual dimension. It's the perfect opening for a scent that provides cool comfort and provocative originality on every level, as a floral heart balances the classic sophistication of orange blossom and lavender against a second, more herbaceous fennel and geranium chord that crackles with electric energy. Fresh and sweet, it all feeds into a gently but brilliantly gourmand base, with the smoothness of cedarwood and balsamic amber providing the perfect contrast to bring out the most in a dried tonka note that evokes both mouthwatering vanilla alongside the ingredient's haylike, outdoorsy qualities.

Kira Kira Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," The heat of summertime in Japan: families gathered in city parks, enjoying a picnic under the brilliant sun which sparkles from the windows of a thousand surrounding skyscrapers in a kaleidoscopic radiance that has a wonderfully onomatopoetic Japanese name: kira kira. Represented here in the form of fragrance, Kira Kira is a delightfully buoyant, exceptionally zen fruity musk scent that weaves Japanese minimalism together with the universal appeal of a day in the summer sun. The very first sniff of Kira Kira is sure to put a smile on anyone's face, combining the energetic snap of fresh mint and tart green apple with the luscious, mouthwatering smoothness of a perfectly ripe pear. The smooth, fresh heart marries the refreshing greenness of lily with the solar glow of hedione, all set against the comforting, gently fruity musk of ambrette spiked with a touch of sake.

Iridescent Sky Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Picture a sweltering but overcast midsummer afternoon in New York City- the puffy clouds hanging low amongst the skyscrapers, backlit by the setting sun to achieve a multi-toned crimson glow. The scents of the city- asphalt, exhaust, concrete- giving a smoky edge to fresh summer breeze, blooming park flowers, and sweet icy treats. The clouds themselves almost look good enough to eat. Iridescent Sky is the smell of that moment. On every level, Iridescent Sky weds a vivacious, juicy summer freshness to smoky cityscape. Bright citrus, juicy blueberry and sweet pineapple are cut with the gentle darkness of black tea, while the smooth rose and orris heart is spiked with a fiery, earthy vetiver. A heavenly ambrette musk in the base is transformed into something distinctly urbanized against metallic aluminum and smoke notes perfectly tuned to add sophisticated contrast without ever losing the evocative joyfulness.

Magenta Pop Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," To Prin Lomros, the hopes and fears, triumphs and failures of young love can be represented by a somewhat unlikely avatar: pop rocks. It's not as crazy as it might seem- aside from being a reliable source of childhood nostalgia, the fizzy, exploding candy is just like the experiences that make up the romantic awakening of adolescence: sweet, painful, exciting, unpredictable, and fleeting. This is the concept behind Magenta Pop, a candy-inspired summer scent of sweet, juicy, occasionally painful romance. Magenta Pop is built around grape, but not the fruity dimensionality of a wine or table grape- the flattened purple sweetness of the ubiquitous candy flavor, syrupy and indulgent. Contrast, therefore, comes with the electric spices meant to convey the crackle of the candy: black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, ginger. Languid honeycomb adds a sugary crunch, while an undercurrent of boozy red wine and animalic leather hint at the deeper, more adult pleasures down the road. If you'd like a grape scent with a bit of grown-up challenge hidden on the edges, Magenta Pop is a testament to coming of age that will make your mouth water- and your heart flutter."," Grape, amber, blueberry, honeycomb, rose, orris, coriander, black pepper, gingerbread, licorice, red wine, leather, atlas cedar, mandarin orange, tobacco, caramel, civet, cinnamon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eternal Summer Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," A green tea field surrounded by a bamboo forest, Eternal Summer takes the summertime theme of Strangers Parfumerie's latest batch of releases and transposes it to a near-mythical plane with a scent that hides impressive sophistication beneath a nearly ethereal first impression. On first sniff, Eternal Summer is a blindingly bright and blissful fruity citrus, featuring the unique facets of fresh kumquat and juicy pear. But a moment's development reveals a gorgeous field of wild green grass, smooth, gentle rose, and a purely lovely green tea note that's nutty, earthy, smooth, and green, all at once. The bamboo forest surrounding it feels appropriately lush, with the gentle strength of gaiac wood and vetiver bringing all elements back together with the perfect touch of honeysuckle. It's remarkably easy to wear, but to call it simple would be a mistake- Eternal Summer is, instead, just a perfect summer scent for any green tea lover."," Kumquat, neroli, pear, grass, rose, bamboo, gaiac, sandalwood, green tea, oakmoss, vetiver, honeysuckle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Comme Un Carrousel Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Summertime nostalgia isn't limited to the innocent bike rides and backyards of pre-adolescence- just as powerfully evocative are the memories (and half-memories) of teenage transgression, the furtive gatherings in cheap hotel rooms and after-dark beaches full of cheap booze, cigarettes, and nervous, hopeful yearning. That's the smell of Comme Un Carrousel, inspired by the wildness of the beach festival season in Nice, France. It's an intoxicating swirl of boozy rum and red wine, smoky tobacco, fizzy cola, and fiery spices that creates an undeniable evocation of the giddy highs and emotional depths of young lovers risking it all night after night. Surprisingly complex, deeply nostalgic, Comme Un Carrousel is the best party your 17 year old self ever attended."," Cola, rum, red wine, red apple, honey, basil, rose, orange flower, cinnamon, coconut, clove, tobacco, vanilla, myrrh, amber, ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Created as a bespoke perfume for Rajesh Balkrishnan by Prin Lomros, HÃ¤xan is a dark witchy fougere style perfume which incorporates dark woody and aromatic elements on a mossy bed representative of the ambience of the smells of places where dark occult ceremonies were conducted.The perfume uses three blends of natural lavender oil surrounded by woody resinous birch, cedar, fir, guaiac, cypriol, sandalwood, wormwood, styrax and pine needle. There are spicy and herbal notes of saffron, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, nutmeg, caraway, cinnamon, violet leaf, tobacco, mushroom, basil, marjoram, and vetiver.

The perfume exudes an air of aromatic mystery and is a shape shifting marvel that ebbs and flows in alternate hues of dark and light.In spite of its dense and dark notes, this is a surprisingly wearable and not overly intense concoction that takes you on a ride into the dark unknown of magic and ancient practices of the surreal considered heretic and profane."," Chamomile, saffron, galbanum, lavender, rosemary, clary sage, marjoram, wormwood, sage, jasmine absolute, cypress absolute, fir balsam, spruce, beeswax absolute, elemi, thyme, basil, oregano, incense, labdanum, goat hair tincture, styrax, opoponax, nutmeg, gaiac, clove, black pepper, caraway, tobacco absolute, castoreum, cedar, sandalwood, cashmeran, mushroom, vetiver, patchouli, muscone",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Tuberose & Moss Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," With striking facets that range from innocently soft to sinfully carnal, tuberose is a grand dame of perfumery, a floral that a perfumer could dedicate a lifetime to. And Manuel Cross' third installment of tuberose is his most creative yet: while Flos Mortis was a snarling bouquet of indole (and Champs Lunaires a smooth and gentle dream), Tuberose & Moss focuses on tuberose's sweet, fruity elements, and in doing so demonstrates that this complex floral can do joyful and bright just as well as dark or soft. And what better base to showcase the sunshine than a classically inflected chypre? Here, Cross plays a fruity, creamy tuberose- delivering the brightness and sweetness that traditionally come from citrus and resin- against a beautiful base of soft, green, real oakmoss. Touches of spice, vanilla, and woods round out the rich dimensionality of the tuberose, and a traditional note of labdanum keeps the tuberose tethered to a chypre structure. Yet again, Manuel Cross has given us a scent that shows us that while both beautiful raw materials or inspired creativity can produce a great fragrance, it's the intersection of the two that can truly speak to the spirit."," Tuberose, Oakmoss, Vanilla Cream, Allspice Berries, Cedar, Labdanum, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

La Surprise Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by The Pursuit, one of four paintings that make up Jean-HonorÃ© Fragonard's ""The Process of Love"" collection, La Surprise is a bright and striking vintage-inflected feminine scent. The painting, meant to depict the first stage of love- courtship- shows a bold young man emerging into a garden where three young ladies are playing in a fountain, offering a rose to his beloved, who turns away in surprise. It's a painting of clever nuance, the outcome uncertain to all involved, from the unsteady suitor to the blushing courtesan to even the apprehensive cherub sculptures who loom above. It's a message, perhaps, about the risks one must take to find love, but also the triumphs that only such risks can produce. As such, La Surprise is a burst of bright, elegant energy, opening with a lovely spicy-green accord that would feel at home among the most romantic French chypres of years past. A heart of luscious white florals meets the timeless pairing of peach and a touch of solar aldehyde, while The Pursuit's singular rose stands out as if carried on the breeze. In appropriately vintage fashion, the base is musky in the traditional use of the term, with enough of a warm, furry animalic purr to evoke the very real desire that lays beneath our subjects' interaction. Parfums MDCI have proven their skill in exploring every facet of France's rich fragrance history; with La Surprise, they gift us with a classically green feminine floral that would be right at home a century ago."," Green accord, cardamom, white flowers, rose, peach, woody accord, musks, solar notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Aimee Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," L'AimÃ©e,  or ""The Beloved, "" is a famous 1794 oil portrait from French master Jacques-Louis David depicting his sister-in-law Madam SÃ©rizat. Painted shortly after his release from Robespierre's prisons following the French Revolution,  this masterwork is renowned for its effortless depiction of the subject's humanity,  portraying Madam SÃ©rizat holding a bouquet in one hand and her child's hand in the other. Its use of soft,  warm color,  as well as subtle touches of exquisite detail on the subject's hands and face,  work together to evoke emotional depth and authenticity that transcend mere photorealism- beneath the surface,  this painting truly breathes. What a delight,  therefore,  that Parfums MDCI has taken its subject to heart,  delivering a fragrance that also glows with abundant humanity and warmth. Despite a complex notes list of citrus,  fine florals,  and rich woods,  resins,  and musks,  L'AimÃ©e turns out to be a fragrance of exquisitely blended softness and light. In a sense,  it feels classical in its romantic depth,  but it surprisingly carries none of the room-filling ostentatiousness one might expect from the notes- there are no sharp edges,  no operatic swells and transitions- instead,  it's the lush romance of a perfectly tuned chamber orchestra. Florals and woods all float on a cloud of pillow-soft musk and vanilla,  aglow with the natural light of sweet fruit and the gentlest touch of castoreum. The result is a fragrance for romantics of all ages,  youthful enough for a princess,  elegant enough for a queen. Though for Monsieur David's sake,  we should point out one needn't support the monarchy to enjoy it."," Bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, Egyptian jasmine, Indian champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, Haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musks, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Coup de Foudre Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Coup de Foudre certainly earns its lightning-inspired name in the opening burst, a brightly colored flash of juicy, sweet citrus and fresh, younger florals. Indeed, the combination of fresh bergamot, bitter grapefruit and sweet orange atop sunny champaca and lush jasmine is a spectacular bouquet unto itself, the kind of gorgeous natural blend that makes you look to the skies as surely as an incandescent streak of electricity across the horizon. But Coup de Foudre is both lightning and thunder, following the arresting energy of its opening with an equally masterful floral heart that resonates with deeply romantic substance. Creamy and buttery, it's filled with sandalwood and even richer cocktail of florals such as rose, carnation, tuberose, ylang-ylang, and lily of the valley. The base, then, is the ominous stillness after the thunder, dark and heavy, yet witah a surprisingly light and gentle feel to it. Slightly smoky guaiac wood, resinous labdanum, balsam tolu oil and rich vanilla are sprinkled with a touch of spicy notes from turmeric and cinnamon. Evocative, romantic, and luxurious, Coup de Foudre isn't just lightning in a bottle- it's the whole storm."," Bergamot, Lemon, Sweet Orange, White Grapefruit, Green Tea, Black Pepper, Jasmine, Rose de Mai, Lily-of-the-valley, Champaca, Ylang-Ylang, Tuberose, Cinnamon, Turmeric, Tonka Bean, Vanilla, Benzoin, Labdanum, Tolu Balsam, Pine, Guaiac Wood, Sandalwood with Pink Lotus infusion, Oud from Trat",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vesna Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," While any scent can introduce unexpected ingredients to a traditional formula, we have a special affection for those that do so with artistic purpose. Vesna Cologne is just such a fragrance, a sweet, fresh, completely wearable homage to classic eaux de cologne with a wonderfully non-traditional list of notes daringly repurposed to create the illusion of a classic citrus EDC. The sunshine of fresh lemon oil is still front and center, but in place of the spicy greenness of petitgrain, we're treated to an alluring decoction of smoothly smoky black tea and piquant tomato leaf, sweetened with a gloriously bright pineapple. Smooth, refreshing magnolia dominates the heart to provide all the water this ""eau"" might need, while a richly woody cypriol (nagarmotha) note in the base feels spicy, robust, and earthy against a sweet, almost boozy dried fruit accord. It's a wonderful olfactory illusion, a feat of scent engineering- at first sniff, a comfortable classic; upon further experience, an ingeniously unique fragrance to explore and savor."," Lemon, Black Tea, Tomato Leaf, Pineapple, Magnolia, Dried Fruits Extrait, Nagarmotha",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moss Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," As prolific of a creator as Dmitri Bortnikoff can be, he deserves equal credit for knowing when not to get in the way of his own exceptional ingredients. Moss Cologne is a perfect example- a showcase of gorgeous natural oakmoss absolute and its resin extracts that proudly exhibits oakmoss in all of its natural beauty, too rarely experienced in modern fragrance. Every other aspect of the scent, from the bright, invigorating citrus of the opening notes to the luxuriously smooth floral heart to the rich, robust base of balsamic woods, all exist to promote the vibrantly fresh, green, earthy character of the oakmoss and show how why it has been one of the most treasured base materials in the history of perfume. Here, it brightens and smooths citrus, adds lush and natural facets to florals, and makes the base feel simultaneously more rugged and refined. In short, it makes every aspect of the scent more complex and compelling while also making it work more effectively with every other aspect- a true miracle note. Effortlessly rich, delightfully sensual, Moss Cologne is the kind of straightforwardly elegant scent that only Bortnikoff seems to know how to make these days. We're hooked."," Bergamot, Lemon, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Oakmoss Absolute, Violet Leaf, Jasmine, Champaca, Ylang-Ylang, Nutmeg, Oakmoss Resinoid, Ambergris, Atlas Cedar, Virginian Cedar, Labdanum, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Golden Dallah Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," In these complicated times, nothing cuts through the stress of life and replenishes the spirit quite like a coffee break. That's the beauty of Xerjoff's Coffee Break collection, inspired by the intriguing and centuries-long history of the international coffee trade. By combining the complex and invigorating essence of fresh ground coffee with the rich gourmand depths of hazelnut, cocoa, and tonka, all wrapped around a complex heart of exquisite rose and Cambodian oud, Golden Dallah proves itself immediately to be one of the most beguiling coffee scents we've ever got our hands on.

Couleur Vanille Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Couleur Vanille is a sweepingly romantic, breezily fresh vision of vanilla inspired by a sailboat cruise around the fabled island of Madagascar. Seeking an escape from cloyingly sweet vanilla gourmand scents, perfumer AliÃ©nor Massenet here delivers something brighter, bolder, and altogether more invigorating, marrying the sumptuous richness of pure Madagascar vanilla with the bracing energy of a salty, iodine-laced breeze of open ocean. The sun's cheerful brightness is represented here with fresh, clean bergamot, while sweetness comes not from sugar, but instead from gorgeously yellow immortelle flower set against supporting notes of benzoin and tolu balsam, which impart subtle depth against the exquisite vanilla base. It's the kind of relaxed, upbeat elegance that L'Artisan is known for- an everyday vanilla of rare distinction."," Bergamot, immortelle, salty notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Sloth Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," With its vibrant, sun-dappled hues, the dense rainforest beckons invitingly. Yet within its misty depths, countless dangers lurk, slinking across the forest floor. Dangling high among the treetops may seem a dubious defence against peril, but for leisurely sloths the forest canopy offers a protective shroud. Safe in their leafy fortress, the sluggish creatures move so slowly even moss overtakes them. They snooze in a cradle of moist green aromas, oblivious to the chaos below.Zoologist Sloth captures the tranquility of this sleepy beast in a soothing green essence. Calming lavender, chamomile, marigold and jasmine combine with the stillness of bittersweet hay and damp moss, stitched together by threads of luscious incense. The result is dreamy and exotic.

Keman Parfum,Di Ser," A Luckyscent limited edition exclusive that quickly sold out when it was introduced in November 2019, Keman is receiving a major recognition that will be announced publicly shortly.

9mm Eau de Parfum,Ballistic Therapy," Leave it to Geza SchÃ¶en to find the soul behind a provocative concept. Ballistic Therapy 9mm- and yes, that's a real (non-live) round in the bottle- is inspired by the serendipitous discovery of gunpowder by ancient Chinese alchemists seeking an elixir of immortality, to instead stumble upon a destructive power that would change the world. Appropriately, 9mm is built on a potent gunpowder accord- smoky, sharp, acrid, with a lingering metallic sweetness. SchÃ¶en explores and expands on each facet of this complex note, supplementing with the sharpness of citrus, the fire of red pepper and cardamom, the smooth modernism of woodsy, vetiver-tinged musky leather. As with all of Geza's creations, it's both sexy and whimsical, eminently wearable yet beguilingly dangerous- a deadly weapon loaded with a wink and a smile."," Gunpowder, bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, black jasmine, red pepper, black orchid, leather, iso-e super, vetiver, gaiac, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/850000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sayat Nova Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," A fragrance that traverses boundaries and continents and creates olfactory poetry. A collaboration between Dmitry Bortnikoff and Rajesh Balkrishnan spanning the careful collection and blending of finest natural absolutes over three continents , Sayat Nova is a composition inspired by the legendary traveling poet of Armenia whose visual poetry influenced generations of artists and visionaries. This perfume realizes this rich flora and fauna of this exotic land in a composition that has never been attempted before in perfumery. Opening with an infusion of exotic fruity flavors and heading to a narcotic floral heart before settling on a bed of exotic Ouds specially distilled for this creation, Sayat Nova is a rare once upon a lifetime opportunity to discover the most exotic poetry distilled into a stunning, resplendent and utterly hypnotic Oriental gourmand scent, the parallels of which will rarely be repeated. Summer 2020 Update: A new batch of Sayat Nova just received; same gorgeous sweet, boozy, rich oud formula."," Oud Laos, Oud Bengal, Oud Trat, Rum, Vanilla, Apricot, Narcissus, Magnolia, Oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Accento Overdose Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," One of the standouts from Xerjoff's Sospiro (now V) line, Accento was the very definition of an elegant feminine scent- an exotic and vivacious burst of tropical fruit and spicy florals layered over a uniquely dry, green patchouli amber. And for the special Overdose edition, that fruity sophistication is given an enchanting new dimension- a proprietary blend of woody musks that intensify and enrich the deeply romantic base to give this version of Accento an unparalleled sophistication. In Accento Overdose, the fruity-floral bouquet still sparkles, with mouthwatering pineapple and deliciously sweet citrus fruits opening into a sumptuous Egyptian jasmine and Bulgarian rose heart that feelers even fuller and more feminine than the original. The green and balsamic facets lend a sensuous fullness, and the newly enhanced base glows with a timelessly romantic warmth. Each Xerjoff Overdose scent proves that even classics can always be re-envisioned, and Accento Overdose may be the most beautiful vision yet."," Fruity notes, green notes, eucalyptus, Mediterranean pine, Egyptian jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51153.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Stars - Alexandria III Parfum,Xerjoff," The Alexandria series is a true achievement for Xerjoff, an elegant series of fragrances based around a rich core of exquisite florals and highest quality ouds from Southeast Asia. Each version plays out with virtuosic grandeur, finding bold new resonance in its variation- a true testament to the legendary opulence of history's greatest metropolis. For Alexandria III, the composition keeps the same notes, but shifts away from the fruit-soaked vivaciousness of previous incarnations in favor of an even richer and woodsier blend.Originally a limited edition of only 99 bottles, each encrusted in golden crystals, Alexandria III is no less radiant in its stunning new packaging. Lavender is still prominent in the opening, but now it brightens a warmer, richer heart of rosewood and lush, narcotic Bulgarian rose, softened with just the right touch of lily of the valley. The oud is every bit as profound as it was in previous iterations, but in III it leaves behind the animalic potency to follow the warm, powdered contours of a base of amber and rich sandalwood that will be wonderfully familiar to fans of Xerjoff's masterpiece Richwood. But make no mistake- with its luscious floral glow, Alexandria III is a masterwork all its own."," Palisander rosewood, lavender, cinnamon, Bulgarian rose, cedar, lily of the valley, oud, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51154.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Atlante Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker," A sense of the ocean permeates all layers of this fresh, taut fragrance. Here, it's a primordial, mythological sea. Beginning with the form of the sea shell, and giving birth to the goddess of beauty. Surrealistically symbolic, as in the work of French cineaste Germaine Dulac, where strong desire and sexuality are never far beneath the shimmering surface. Fresh and beautiful, but not without an undertow.  Atlante was a finalist for the 2019 Art + Olfaction Awards"," Yuzu, seaweed, orris, lily of the valley, pink pepper, wet rock, cedar, ambergris, seashell, driftwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/849000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Charade Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker, Cross and double-cross. It's never easy to tell who's fooling who when high stakes and artful chicanery are at play.

Greek Keys Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker," The persistent freshness of an ancient form. The waves of fragrance that flood Aegean isles from all directions in the heat of the day, shifting shape under the starry sky of night.

Jungle Jezebel Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker," Inspired by cult performer and singer, Divine, this is a fragrance with real attitude. A heady mÃ©lange of tropical fruits. The exotic sweetness is balanced with far heavier, sexy tonalities that become more prominent as it dries down. The unique combinations are unexpected and make this a fragrance that stands apart, at once memorable and perhaps even a little shocking on first encounter. Yet, like its inspiration, the scandalous first impression reveals a craft that impresses and remains memorable. One for daring people who walk their own path."," Orange, banana, grape, peach, bubble gum, rose, tuberose, ylang-ylang, amber, sandalwood, civet, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/849003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lace Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker, Not the lace of the boudoir. Here regal elegance is ideally suited to occasions that call for discretion and restraint.

Leopard Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker," There's no point lying about it: the premonition of an epic night on the tiles is inescapable.

Rules of Attraction Extrait de Parfum,Sarah Baker," An homage to a famed fragrance, this re-consideration of a ball at Versailles sees through the rose-tinted romantic vision to much darker energies. Dangerous liaisons at court and contemporary iterations in writings that are often shocking. Here, the flowers in the garden are all beautiful, but some signal danger.

Proxima Eau de Parfum,Centauri Perfumes," The closest star to Earth in the Centaurus constellation, Proxima is a flare star, capable of stunning flashes of brightness. It's the perfect name for the newest and best yet release from Centauri Perfumes, a space-age blend of fruits, musky florals, and avant-garde ozonic notes that manages to be both wondrously creative and yet impressively wearable. Proxima presents itself as one-of-kind from the very first burst of out-of-this-world fruit- a brilliantly bright grapefruit, sweetly aromatic blackcurrant, and a tart, neon strawberry. The heart is fresh and sharp, with the crisply clean ozonic notes of pure air at high altitude, with subtle floral accents leading into a glowing base of musky woods that pulse like an aurora.

New York Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," It's not easy to capture one of the most diverse, evolving and breathtaking cities in the world in one single fragrance- so Fragrance du Bois decided to make two instead, one each for the disparate but equally magical NYC summers and winters. New York Intense represents the vibrant summertime of NYC, irresistible and unique like the city itself. The top note is a spicy, sparkling citrus, with just a hint of floral accords- a sharper, more masculine-feeling counterpart to 5th Avenue. A balsamic and woodsy heart deepens the sensuality with olibanum, guaiac wood, clove, and immortelle, feeling rich and luxurious. A complex and powerful base featuring oud, amber, and myrrh smolders like the city at noon, albeit with the sophistication and refinement of observing Central Park from 50 stories above. Opulent, yet impeccably tasteful, New York Intense is an undeniable triumph."," Cinnamon, Coriander, Orange, Blackberry, Bay Leaf, Rose, Olibanum, Guaiac Wood, Clove, Vanilla, Honey, Immortelle, Orchid, Vetiver, Cedarwood, Oud, Myrhh, Patchouli, Musk, Amber, Labdanum, Oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757034.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
New York 5th Avenue Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," It's not easy to capture one of the most diverse, evolving and breathtaking cities in the world in one single fragrance- so Fragrance du Bois decided to make two instead, one each for the disparate but equally enchanting NYC summers and winters. New York 5th Avenue, dedicated to the magic of winter and the holidays in New York City, is a luxurious throwback to the vintage grandeur of past perfumes. Its sweet, woodsy, and opulent floral profile opens with the bright clarity of a rose top note, brightened with bergamot and leading into a marvelously classical-feeling spicy floral heart with just the right touch of musky complexity. Even as a luscious vanilla, cashmere wood, and gaiac base emerge, the multidimensional beauty of the florals linger, connecting the romance of old New York to the vibrant excitement of its future. Glamorous and enchanting, New York 5th Avenue is a fragrance for the dreamers."," Bergamot, Rose, Caramel, Violet, Cyproil, Vanilla, Musk, Cashmere Wood, Guaiac Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757035.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Amber,Fragrance du Bois," Velvet Amber can be defined as a fresh spicy woody fragrance. It opens with spicy citrus top note coming from bergamot, geranium, lemon and cardamom, then a very sophisticated heart note mixes the charm of rose with saffron, leather and cypriol. The strong cypriol accord stays in the base note and creates a great synergetic long lasting well composed base that includes sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, musk, Oud oil and of course amber."," Bergamot, Geranium, Lemon & Cardamom, Rose, Saffron, Leather, Cypriol, Amber, Sandalwood, Patchuli, Vanilla, Musk and Oud Oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757037.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cannabis Blue Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois, Perfumer Christian Provenzano has created a cannabis accord that vibrates with daring Oud facets and smoky wood tones of guaiac and patchouli.

Ishtar Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Part of the joy of Rogue's dedication to exquisite natural materials- regulators be damned- is a spontaneity of creation that simply cannot come from synthetic-heavy, bottom-line-oriented mass market creations. Ishtar is a perfect example- originally conceived as an aromatic fresh scent with a woodsy base, it turned out quite a bit different, as Manuel Cross found that two of the notes meant for the background- a smoky, silvery frankincense and a sweet, resinous benzoin- kept rising to the top of the composition regardless of proportions. Luckily, he was able to realize the serendipity at play, and the result is a dynamic, gorgeous incense scent with a wonderfully fresh sweetness. Juniper and lily, perhaps the star players in a different fragrance, go to work here enhancing the brightest and cleanest aspects of the frankincense, helping massage the profile from cold, churchy starkness into something greener, fresher, and more exuberantly lively. Similarly, the benzoin blends perfectly with sweet, woodsy myrrh and a spot of sandalwood- not a rough edge to be found. If Ishtar wasn't meant to be an incense scent, it might not have turned out quite as planned. Then again, nothing truly inspired ever does."," Frankincense, benzoin, juniper, myrrh, lily, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin Antique Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Jasmine lovers, listen closely- you know how Rogue Perfumery has built a reputation for delivering impossibly full-bodied, deeply evocative perfumes unencumbered by regulatory blandness? Now imagine what that unrestricted vintage beauty might smell like in the service of a soliflore built around one a beguilingly complex natural jasmine grandiflorum- rich with cascading tones of lush petals, fruity fullness, seductive spice, and animalic sensuality. It's a massive, luscious fragrance, with every wondrous aspect of jasmine harmonizing with the rest to achieve a blissfully narcotic white floral. If you're anything like us, you'll be sniffing your wrists all day, discovering something new each time. Jasmine scents like Jasmin Antique don't come along every day- but don't take our word for it."," Jasmine Grandiflorum blossoms, musk, clove, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flos Mortis Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Flos Mortis (flower of death) seems a bit dark and droll for a perfume concept but there is nothing dead or dull about it. This hardcore tuberose fragrance is a narcotic floral composed to be an indolic dirge, headed by tuberose and Indian jasmine. The composition focuses on Tuberose's indolic properties from both the fresh blossoms and the absolute. The indole note in Flos Mortis actually makes up 5% of the formula but is tempered with some Indian jasmine (grandiflorum) which shares similar indolic properties. The addition of red currant and osmanthus add some smooth and delicious fruitiness, while the raw black leather leather accord carries forth the rest of the animalic onslaught.From its sweet, dark floral opening to its leathery mid-notes Flos Mortis is nowhere near conventional. It's a fascinating Victorian beast whose inciting snarl dares you to revel in a liminal space of beauty and darkness. A true work of wonder that is sure to hold a treasured place in your own cabinet of curiosities."," Indolic Tuberose Absolute, Indian Jasmine, Osmanthus, Red Currant, Leather, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The second release of their ""fragrance enhancers, "" these are a fun way to start experimenting with wearing multiple perfumes at a time. But don't let the tagline fool you- these are every bit their own stand alone fragrances,  addictively sheer but with enough presence to have strangers stopping you to ask,  ""what's that you're wearing?"" The fragrance is a soft crystalline perfume that highlights the humid parts inside of a flower. A modern dewy orange blossom water inspired by the memory of a more traditional orange blossom water sprinkled in the air in a market on the back streets of Fez in Morocco.

Sedley Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," A fragrance of unparalleled freshness and deceptive complexity, Sedley is a dynamically bright men's fragrance for those who know the power of confident subtlety. While it doesn't enter the room in front of you the way many of Parfums de Marly's powerhouse classics do, its bright, light aromatic citrus opening steadily develops on the skin into a beguiling woodsy masculine that hits its stride just as you hit yours. But first, a bit more about that opening- a hesperidic trio of mandarin, grapefruit, and lemon that combines the best of all three- tart, bright, juicy, and sharp, with the herbaceous, aromatic zing of mint and rosemary. Sedley's development is impressively judicious- the top notes linger well past a normal opening, and the classic gentleman's heart of lavender and geranium comes on so gradually that you may find yourself seduced by your own fragrance. And with that same deliberation, a warm, smooth, powerful base of musky woods emerges that hums on the skin with potent energy. It's often said that real men speak softly and let their actions do the talking. If that's you, Sedley is your fragrance."," Mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, mint, rosemary, geranium, lavender, olibanum, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, cashmeran, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70033.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tigerlust Pure Parfum,Ensar Oud," Typically, perfumers have a vision in mind, be it a feeling they want to evoke or a marketing theme they have to match. It didn't work that way this time. This fragrance was simply born out of Ensar Oud's love of contrasts and experimentation. A curiosity to know what happens when frangipani oozes into orris root and civet gets high on Sichuan pepper. When crushed ambergris sticks to blackcurrant and castoreum goes for a swim in a lake of osmanthus. When obscene amounts of artisanal Chinese oud, Sri Lankan oud, and Maroke oud are poured into an animalic cocktail and then left to steep in vintage Timor sandalwood, tobacco leaf and coffee flower, you really just don't know what to expect. Enter Tigerlust. Primal, sensual ”” sexual, even”” this is what happens when Siberian musk comes into contact with gyrinops from the highest mountain peaks of Irian Jaya and they go for a stroll in the Italian countryside.It's a fragrance you want to embrace; to make it a part of you every bit as much as the steaming presence of an untamed lover's skin. An enticing musk, with rose and jasmine hastening it's intrigue. The top notes are discreetly citrusy, the heart notes shamelessly saucy, and the base is all ouds slooshing drunk on oud, tempered by Mysore from the mid-70s. All the most expensive/sought-after/precious perfume ingredients here, waiting to be experienced. Decadent amounts of all of them in their most pristine form (100% natural, undiluted extracts), carefully proportioned not to let any one steal the show.Beautifully hand-bound in embossed full-grain Italian calf hide by Habib Dingle, leather sage of the century.","Citrus, Fruit, Sweet Aromatic spices, Herbs, Aromatic Woods, Sandalwood, Siberian musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Naga Layyen Organic Oud Pure Oud,Ensar Oud," A cocktail of spiced plums, tangy nectarines, and ginger-infused black tea awaits. As the hours glide by, you'll notice the effulgent syrupy guava heart notes mesh into a dark honey-like sweet aroma, leaving you with a breezy, zesty olfactory delight. All of this with a musky primal thump.Naga Layyen is maple syrup thick. Quiet, saffron-sandalwood top notes imbued with crassnan green fuse into an unusually woody heart. A dry cedar-liken woodiness that gives the driest of Borneos a run for their money but with a spicy rooibos wildflower fusion no Borneo can ever hope to possess.","spiced plums, tangy nectarines, ginger-infused black tea, guava, musk, honey, saffron, sandalwood, wildflowers, woody",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
People's Kampot Organic Oud Pure Oud,Ensar Oud," People's Kampot is the cry of the jungle. The bulk of the agarwood distilled was wild, collected along the mountain range where Koh Kong meets Pursat  and where the trees are decades old.This oil boasts a medicinal red, bitter-fruity accord infused with the resinous core of an old Kampot oud. This oud has just enough rawness to compliment the oolong, tobacco leaf, and lightly smoked puerh. A refreshing tamarind tartness with a minty zing that is bursting with fruit. Very long lasting on the skin, a scent to be relished all day long all the way through its scrumptious peppery base drydown.","oolong, tobacco leaf, smoked puerh, accord, tamarind",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Then, when the velvety feel meets your skin, it's all charisma. Deep. Mellow. An oud with a story to tell. A powdery pipe tobacco aura with an ultra laid-back mood at its heart. Herbaceous and fruity with a thick woody cherry jam that runs head-first into a subtle sweetshrub-laced spiciness that makes your mouth water and your nose scream for more. Layers of lush tobacco drenched in agar syrup with a bombastic burst of resin, incense, molasses, and that signature Cambodian oud zest from yesteryear.

Satori Fusho Organic Oud,Ensar Oud," Frangisteria might be the best name to describe this oud's heartnote, a see-through crispness that purrs with Thai frangipani and Western wisterias, infused with gently steeped Japanese green tea. The incense notes are so delicate, richly layered. The top notes are pristine and crystalline. An ethereal kukicha-matcha leaf note that seeps throughout your wear. Upon first whiff, you'd think the fragrance couldn't get any more clear cut and translucent, but just wait an hour and take another whiff! The scent transforms into a feast of blue gyrinops painted green doused in slow-releasing incense.","Thai frangipani, Western wisterias, Japanese green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois de Borneo Oud,Ensar Oud," If you haven't yet joined the barnyard fan club, or want to take a break from the fruitier ouds, then Bois de Borneo's bare bones agarwood is for you. Relish the honeysuckle, the naked-earth-meets-honey head and heart. But what will really keep your nose glued to your wrist is the baritone of sizzling Borneo chips that hold the lead throughout this woodchant fantasy.It all mellows into an enchanting Malinau dry-down that seems to never end. Bois de Borneo boasts robust tenacity on the skin and on clothing, it will last for weeks. If you're new to oud, this is a great first choice. If you're a seasoned collector, you've just found that perfect, ultra versatile daily swiper you've been waiting for all this time.","Agarwoord, Honeysuckle, Borneo chips, Malinau, Creamy, Smoky, Resinous, Oriental ",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
American Oud,Ensar Oud," A smell that brings to life Hemingway's bullfighting, marlin-chasing madness and reminds you of the sweaty Strauss days of rough love and worn leather out on the road. A rich chocolatey smoky leather oud often compared to the infamous Tigerwood Royale. Indulge in the glory of an Oud that breathes out the resinous ooze of old-school Sumatran agar, bathed in the nose-piercing green incense of walla. What's best is how this intoxicating brew works with your skin and brings to life your own natural pheromonal aroma, just like on that day on the boat with the marlin hanging high, when you biked home after. That's what good perfumes ought to do. Get ready to bask in its complexity and enjoy the ride.","Chocolatey, Smoky, Leather, Resinous, Sumatran agar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal d'Assam Perfume oil,Ensar Oud," Hailing from Assam, India, here's a jewel that'll rock your aromatic world. This santal boasts the most vanillicious citrus twang and musky aroma you could imagine. Often santal oils are deployed as a supporting carrier in attars but it would be unthinkable to not enjoy this precious olfactory gem on its own. A complete perfume in its own right, replete with notes of spices, animalics, mind-bending floral chords and, of course, a to-die-for woody drydown that is unparalleled.Here is a truly formidable feat of olfaction: a scent that is at once sublimely linear yet potent and rich.

Bliss du Boche Oud Pure Oud,Ensar Oud," Like a bouquet made of many kinds of flowers, this oud oil gathers different batches of agarwood from all over Cambodia to create a distillation that gives you fantastically prismatic floral tones, rounded off with just the right amount of fruity zest to make this one Ensar Oud's most treasured brews.On top of the robustness of the aroma, the integrity of the scent (how the heart of the fragrance remains intact down through the drydown), the artisanal execution of the distillation, you'll delight in rich fruity chords, spiced molasses, violet leaf and lilac held together by a soft chai creaminess.Bliss du Boche is so exotic it demands to be worn. As rich and layered an oud as you could wish for and a total pleasure to wear.

Sultan Musk Attar Perfume Oil,Ensar Oud," All spiced up and sumptuous. A sensual, naturalistic aroma that smells of animal yet enthralls with its beauty. This is the scent of a passionate caress. From Siberian musk-infused Santal Royale to exotic pepper extracts that smell muskier than muskrat, splashes of post-coital sweat, grapefruit and animalics emerge that take you to a proper bestial muskiness accentuated by civet, cumin, and other highly problematic aromatics. They merge into an ultra-steroidal foundation for the floral  notes. After the floral notes quieten, the soft basmati rice emerges, the baby skin effect of a perfect musky drydown.A special Japanese rose injects the risquÃ© with enough romantique to let the scent share the bed with the ballroom; featured here alongside a trio of Himalayan, Turkish, and Edward roses. The floral tenor is sensual and richer than the most masterful soliflores but exalted further by the musk. All the while Sambac looms regally on top, adding to the complexity of the heartnotes, rendering them into a delicious blend of pepper and spice. It is a jasminized spicy and musky carnality that comes for you whether you like it or not.","Muskrat, post-coital sweat, Grapefruit, Animalics, Siberian musk, Exotic Pepper, civet, cumin, Japanese Rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Namasoma Organic Oud Pure Oud,Ensar Oud," Artisanal oud oil is rich and complex, with scent notes tightly dancing together. While this oud retains a delicious fruity Thai base, Namasoma brings out a floral dimension that is unmatched. Its scent progression is slow and gives you plenty of time to get stuck amidst freesias and sweet peas before you're thrown into a mash of freshly crushed magnolia petals.Because of its super accessible floweriness, Namasoma is perfect to wear around the unaccustomed Western palette. You might just have somebody in the office cry out,“Who brought the carnations?""","Fruity, Floral, Namasoma, Freesias, Sweet Pea, Magnolia Petals, Carnations",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Spicematic Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The joy of Pierre Guillaume's ""flanker"" scents is that they're anything but retreads of their original inspiration- instead they have the iterative energy of a maestro composing variations on a theme, using the constraints of a single concept to focus his energy on the serendipitous. In Spicematic 11.2, Guillaume revisits the ""aromatic-spice"" nexus that gave us the desert lemon mint and allspice of Harmatan Noir and the sub-tropical peppermint and cardamom of Indian Wood, but here, our inspiration is the cold, mineralic beauty of marble, represented in saffron, fresh ginger, and green mint. With a molecular distillation of incense adding an intense coolness, the fragrance shines and sparkles, tempered only by the organic vibration of red cedar and the resinous heat of Siberian pine. Pierre Guillaume describes Spicematic as ""marble water."" Who are we to disagree?"," Saffron, ginger, mint, incense, red cedar, pine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34557.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Meet Me On The Corner Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Meet Me On The Corner is a fragrance inspired by the 1970s but updated by about a half century. It's named after the Lindisfarne song, and captures the days when a date was just two people showing up to the same place at the same time- no texts, no swiping right, no GPS. It takes a staple of the '70s- the citrus chypre- and supplements the carefree excitement of the classic style with a serious dose of 2020 sophistication. The key to Meet Me On The Corner is three essential oils: mandora- a hybrid citrus born of sweet orange and mandarin, grown in Cyprus- plus magnolia flower, and magnolia leaf. Mandora gives the lemon and mandarin topnote a bright new sunshiny feeling. Using magnolia instead of the traditional tuberose and rosewood brings softness to the romantic heart of the scent. And in the base, all the hallmarks of a timeless chypre- moss, patchouli and styrax blended and matured in bergamot, surrounded by gentle musks. Think of this 1970-meets-2020 concept as a new Mini Cooper- all the fun of driving the original... now with working brakes and windshield wipers."," Lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musks, styrax, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aseel Attar / Perfume Oil,Fragrance du Bois," From the Arabic word for ""original, "" Aseel is a potently spicy,  yet delightfully fresh attar creation that more than lives up to its name. Featuring rich,  traditional accords well known on the Arabian peninsula such as cardamom and oud oil,  it represents both the origins of Arab culture,  while also feeling vibrantly new. Aseel opens with an electric current of ginger and cardamom amplified with the citrussy freshness of bergamot. The rich,  lively spice theme continues in the heart with coriander and nutmeg,  both in service of a stunning geranium note- fresh,  rich,  and rosy. And finally,  in the true spirit of an attar,  a potent and extremely long lasting base of two separate oud accords- Thai and Indian- which blend with smooth musk and cedarwood to create a sumptuous and sensual tapestry. Lush and layered enough to satisfy any attar lover,  yet fresh enough to wear any day,  Aseel is a standout."," Ginger, Cardamom, Bergamot, Coriander, Nutmeg, Geranium, Trat Oud Oil, White Musk, Indian Oud oil, Cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arabesque Attar / Perfume Oil,Fragrance du Bois," Elegant, lively, and enchantingly deep, Arabesque is a compellingly non-traditional attar. Opening with bright spice, jammy fruit, and tart citrus, it immediately radiates playful warmth, even before the lushly romantic heart of white oud, rose, and geranium emerge into the spotlight. The base is long lasting, sweet, and fresh, with creamy sandalwood, smooth musk, and warm amber."," Apple, Blackberry, Saffron, Citrus Notes, White Oud, Rose, Geranium, Sandal Wood, Cedar, Musk, Amber, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757032.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mutheer Attar / Perfume Oil,Fragrance du Bois," ""Mutheer"" means seductive, and we can't think of a better way to describe this rich, sensual attar featuring a bouquet of lusciously decadent florals. Opening with a bright burst of fruity citrus softened with a touch of green hyacinth, Mutheer quickly gets to the powerful floral heart, where delightfully fresh peony supports a sumptuously feminine main note of Bulgarian rose.

Rose Du Bois Attar / Perfume Oil,Fragrance du Bois," A revolutionary Rose fragrance.Almost 90% of the blend is Damascus Rose (Ward Dimshaki), using one of the most famous and precious Rose Oils in the world, yet the fragrance with a hint of Saffron and Cardamom note then rests on the queen of flowers, the Rose. A hint of amber to add some sweetness.This attar can be identified as a powdery, fresh and floral fragrance, an intensely romantic one."," Saffron, Cardamom, Damascus Rose, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aran Parfum,PRIN," From the Thai for ""forest, "" Aran is an enchantingly dark voyage into a dense fantasyland teeming with both creatures and plants never before seen. Beneath a lush green canopy,  a leather scent of unparalleled animalism lurks,  with potent doses of civet and castoreum intensified by an actual goat hair extract- animalic lovers,  this may be a new holy grail. But the raw carnality is exquisitely balanced against both the wild,  herbaceous,  and earthy green notes and a potent,  spiritual incense- rich,  warm,  and uplifting. In its blend of natural and supernatural,  flora and fauna,  comfort and danger,  Aran is like ancient folklore made wearable- a scent with deep mythic power."," Goat hair, leather, frankincense, civet, castoreum, oakmoss, saffron, fir balsam, jasmine, jatamansi, cardamom, nagarmotha, tobacco, vetiver, mushroom, oud, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anatolia Parfum,PRIN," The bridge between continents, Anatolia was a nexus for the conflicting tides of humanity- a centerpoint of economic, cultural, and even genetic exchange. Anatolia the fragrance celebrates this diversity in a sweeping oriental gourmand that incorporates a multitude of unique materials that might have passed across the plateau in ancient times- the earthy richness of dried fruits made sweet with the historic confections of loukhoum and honey, contrasted against the fiery spice of cumin and cinnamon and the spiritual brightness of incense smoke. Underneath it all, the supple, road-worn leather of the travelers and merchants who brought these treasures back and forth across the silk road, creating new cultures that endure until this day. Lovers of semi-gourmande leather, you won't want to miss this one."," Leather, date, apple, oud, cinnamon, cumin, patchouli, amber, incense, loukhoum, cacao powder, honey, suede",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandodari Parfum,PRIN," Mandodari, or Montho in Thai: the queen consort of Ravana in Ramanyana, ""beautiful, pious, and righteous"": and yet, tragically exploited, ignored, and betrayed by her husband and the gods. With Mandodari, Prin Lomros honors her struggle, giving to her the redemption arc the stories never could with a sweepingly gorgeous and complex floral oriental that seamlessly melds the divine with the earthly. Mandodari is built around a sparkling bouquet of aldehyde-kissed florals- smooth, fresh champaca, sweet frangipani, narcotic tuberose, carnal gardenia. Beneath the brightness, a swirl of mysterious spices lurk- rich coffee, fiery black pepper, and an ash-enhanced curl of smoky tobacco atop a darkly woodsy base. It's a clever, empathetic nod to the darkness that lies beneath the beauty, a gesture to the unspoken tragedy of the mythology. For those who love beautiful aldehydic florals but long for a bit more substance and sophistication, Mandodari is a revelation."," Champaca, tuberose, gardenia, frangipani, aldehydes, coffee absolute, opium, black pepper, civet*, tobacco, oakmoss, ash, cumin, sandalwood, teak. *does not contain any actual animal products",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mriga Parfum,PRIN," Mriga- from the Sanskrit word for ""deer."" Fear not, however, animal lovers, Mriga contains no actual deer musk, but simply an ingenious synthetic deer musk accord, perhaps the most accurate one we've ever smelled, able to impressively capture the subtly sweet, powdery, furry aspects of real musk with far more nuance than the average substitute. And Prin Lomros makes the most of this striking accord, supplementing it with an array of florals and resins designed both to evoke the natural Himalayas habitat that such a deer might find himself in, while also drawing out the aphrodisiac elements of deer musk that have brought the material such breathless renown. Lime teases out that ribbon of brightness that so often separates real musk from its imitators, while a root-to-leaf collage of arboreal fragrant materials- fir balsam, spruce, oakmoss, sandalwood- lend a striking natural dimensionality. Invigorating and substantial, Mriga is a dream come true for anyone who would love a true deer musk scent without the ethical dilemma."," Deer musk accord*, lime, fir balsam, black spruce, grass, cade, oakmoss, oud, vetiver, nagarmotha, rose, sandalwood, jasmine, costus, wormwood, labdanum, peat *this fragrance contains no animal products",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Nocturne Absolu Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Vetiver Nocturne Absolu takes the majesty of the original Vetiver Nocturne to a new and intensified level. This uncompromisingly regal and mysterious creation is rich, enticing and captivating.The earthy, green and complex scent of vetiver is blended with the highest quality supporting ingredients for a perfume which redefines this well know fragrance note and frames it in a way which elevates it to the resplendent position which it truly merits.The long cherished beauty of neroli provides a burst of freshness in the opening. Indonesian and Indian Vetiver combine for a tantalizingly rich and naturalistic accord. Jasmine Sambac in the heart of the scent is combined with the unique addition of sandalwood oil which has been infused with champaca flowers and leaves. In the base of the scent, smooth and luxurious Bengalian and Indian sandalwood meet grey and white amber and oak moss for a classic foundation. The exotic sensuousness of sweet oud from Trat blends with precious myrrh to provide an intriguingly dark and opulent undertone.The meticulous search for the perfect ingredients and the painstaking distillation processes used by perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff mean that, like the original Vetiver Nocturne, this fragrance will surprise and amaze those who felt that they had understood all that vetiver has to offer.  Furnished with the ideal surrounding accords, this long established perfume ingredient now reveals hitherto undiscovered facets of its complex olfactory personality."," Indonesian Vetiver, Neroli, Indian Vetiver, Jasmin Sambac, Champaca Flowers and Leaves infused in Sandalwood oil, Bengalian Sandalwood, Indonesian Sandalwood, Grey and White Amber, Oakmoss, Sweet Oud from Trat, Myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Sinharaja Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Oud Sinharaja is a unique, one of a kind fragrance harnessing the beauty of the essential oil of wild oud from Sri Lanka. This oil is distilled personally by perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff and is therefore a truly special and inimitable ingredient.This spectacular evocation of the Sinharaja rainforest in Sri Lanka will inspire and enliven you with its ethereal beauty and seductive complexity.

The juicy citrus and breezy floral tones make this a perfect scent for any occasion. The rare and exotic oud at the base of the scent provides a rich and exotic counterpoint which works in perfect harmony, complimenting but never overpowering the other notes."," Bergamot, Pink Grapefruit, Cardamom, Frangipani, Magnolia, Jasmine Sambac, Essential oil of Wild Oud from Sri Lanka, Atlas Cedar, Labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Medullary-ray Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," The metallic rasp of blade against ancient timber, the aroma of fresh shavings and static heartwood curls.Medullary-ray presents a floating balance of intimate tensions. The handling of opposing materials creates a sympathetic space before unifying to produce a hypnotic fibrous signature. Savory fruits and dry botanicals lift this inceptive sawdust profile; a fresco of gilded flowers and grasses enriched with balsamic resins. Voluminous layers of bronzed wood tones stabilize Medullary-ray creating a profound texture, faÃ§ade and resonance. A cadence of root and smoke creates an ethereal trail that enthralls. Look out for the glimmers of saccharine red fruits, delicious if caught, even if only momentarily. Medullary-ray is an olfactory encounter between crafted wood and lazily harvested Tuscan fruits."," Fig-leaf, Cardamom, Olive, Juniper, Frankincense, Orris Butter, Rose Absolute, Pomegranate, Myrrh, Vetiver, Guaic wood, Papyrus, Hay, Birch, Cedar wood, Castoreum, Valerian, Sandalwood Oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carduus Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," Unashamedly polarizing, Carduus is a blend of jagged leaves, herbal seeds and xeric barks.Carduus assaults with a potent crash of warm gustatory herbs, tingling seeds and defensive leaves. This dry herbal bouquet prevails over medicinal botanicals, ardent barks and bruised molecules. The resulting effect conjures images of untold ceremony and ritual. The fragrance flirts with tradition; aged herbs and spices blended alchemically, it is ceremonious and spiritual. This romantic brew is woven with bundles of complex flower essences and fermented leaves before revealing its sweet confections and pounded roots. There is unusual buoyancy experienced with Carduus. Starting extremely rich, dense and laced with spices before shedding layers to reveal a veiled and noble incense facet that feels weightless."," Chamomile, Bengal Pepper, Honey, Clary Sage, Sea-holly, Marjoram Tea, Myrtle, Rose Absolute, Vetch, Clove Bud, Hart's Tongue, Tuberose, Musk-thistle, Heliotrope, Tormentil, Mahogany, Cocoa Absolute, Tobacco, Meum, Deertongue, Cherrywood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Trimerous Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," Trimerous is a funny little thing. A triptych of veils shading the finest facets of prized orris root.Quivering around the most exquisite Florentine Orris Butter, Trimerous presents undulating olfactory movements, displaying singular facets of the revered root in a landscape of dewy, verglas and silvered woods. Trimerous does not explore every kaleidoscopic nuance of the noble root, instead honoring but three slivers often overlooked. Trimerous highlights the forgotten, muted and the discarded; effervescent, buttery and exalting. Trimerous is as much an attempt to capture a mood and a process as it is to showcase the aromatic splendor of the iris, an inherently faultless raw material. This is a ballad to the devoted hand, soiled, aged yet resiliently tending to rhizome."," Carrot Seed, Bergamot, Nectarine, Thyme, Cicely, Pink Pepper, Juniper, Cloudberry, Angelica Root, Orris Butter, Kombucha, Centaury, Suede, Oud, Musk, Ambergris, Styrax, Vanilla, Incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Phloem Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," What a sticky mess. Phloem is a diabolical assemblage of odorants that should oppose, but somehow attract.There is a violent, primal sensuality that bewitches before embracing. The entire composition is a balancing act of contradicting raw materials blended instinctually to create a shocking and diffusive bouquet of devastating release. Phloem presents a miasma of olfactory sin; flushed skin, shoreline, carnival frivolities, caviar, lipstick smears and erogenous effluvium. Sucrose-sweetness is tempered with greasy spices that hinder Phloem from sliding into tooth-achingly sweet territory. A damp note of nutty driftwood and hot gooey styrax gum continues deep into the fade. Phloem is hallucinogenic vapor with a marbled psychedelic development."," Passion Fruit, Rhubarb, Mulberry, Nasturtium, Honeysuckle, Blaeberry, Camellia, Oysterplant, Meadowsweet, Gorse, Ambrette, Sesame, Amyris, Tonka Bean Absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nectary Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio," Nectary is a profusion of diaphanous flowers. A modern alternative to more traditional signatures.This is a brutal floral bouquet, abundant with honeyed sweetness and oozing with precious sap. There is a beguiling tartness as Nectary unfurls. A ripe, juicy nuance compliments narcotic blushed petals adding unfiltered naturalness. Nectary is not a preened garden; there is bravado and danger lurking at every twist and turn. To disturb the slumbering flowers would prove perilous. Crude terra cotta vases spill with fruit-baring inflorescences.

Salam Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Salam is a fragrance of serendipitous romance- a gorgeously vivid celebration of chance encounters that lead to love at first sight. Modelled on the concept of two people destined to cross paths, and the scents of the bustling street that leads them unknowingly towards one another, it's a rich, sweet floral oriental that perfectly captures the unmistakable buzz of an instant connection, where every small detail feels like it portends a bright and joyous future.On this picture-perfect street, our future lovers are primed for romance with a delightful montage of scents- the bright, juicy citrus of bergamot and mandarin, layered against the intoxicating beauty of freshly-cut white flowers. A warm, sweet amber heart glows like the midday sunshine, imbuing Salam with a deep sense of calm, as if to reassure us that this meeting was, in fact, meant to be- a sensation only deepened in the final phase of the fragrance, a gently rapturous base of smooth musk and creamy sandalwood that reflects the quiet joy of two souls that have found one another."," Bergamot, mandarin, amber, jasmine, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Allegretto 7.2 Eau de Parfum,Berceuse Parfum," How does melancholy become beautiful? Listen to the stirring, sombre second movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony and imagine how it might smell. Dark, sweeping, poignant: this is Allegretto 7.2.A study in theme and variations, Allegretto is built around Haitian vetiver that brightens and darkens as it develops, layering earthy scents, smoke, and lavender.Allegretto 7.2's notes recede and repeat rhythmically. A fresh mint top note poises in the air like a conductor's baton, soon giving way to swirls of smoke, roots, and moist green leaves. Aromas of fresh-turned earth and wild vegetation join lavender and herbs at the heart. Then, as it falls from its crescendo, Allegretto settles on a warm base of cedar wood, vanilla, and benzoin. With its dynamic, seductive pulse, Allegretto is vetiver transcendent."," vetiver, smoke, lavender, mint, herbs, cedar wood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/845000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peregrina Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," Even amongst the most famous precious stones in the world, La Peregrina stands out- a perfectly formed pear-shaped pearl, one of the largest in the world, with a stunning legacy that includes King Philip II of Spain, Napoleon III, and, more recently, Elizabeth Taylor. With a backstory like that, any fragrance to use the name had best be something special. Luckily, Peregrina, the newest from Thameen, is more than up to the challenge- a rich, warm blend of lush florals and spicy resins that exudes royal opulence and Old Hollywood glamour with equal abundance. Like its namesake pearl, Peregrina announces itself already fully formed, eschewing a traditional opening in favor of getting right to the rich, luscious heart of alluring myrrh, mouthwatering vanilla and a seductively sweet ylang ylang supplemented by Damascus rose, gardenia, and jasmine. The base takes the aromatic warmth of the scent to the next level, combining a sweet, resinous amber with smooth white musk. The overall effect is complex and extravagant but disarmingly easy to wear, with a perfectly timeless style- in other words, just as elegant and effortless as a perfect pearl."," Rose Damascene, Lily Of The Valley, Gardenia, Jasmin, Vanilla, Amber, Caramel, Myrrh, Ylang Ylang, White Musk, Amber, Poudre",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/734023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cigar Rum Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," The name - Cigar Rum – is a bit on the nose. But the scent itself? A surprisingly delicate and detailed piece of work that, while definitely redolent of the rich, dried fruit and tobacco leaves soaking in oak caskets of Caribbean island booze implied in the name, has a lightness to it that makes it a fabulously easy wear. We think that part of what makes Cigar Rum such a great candidate for office wear and daytime is that the layers of balsamic woods, tobacco, and dried fruit are dry and crisp, aerated by a salty note that might be the seaweed absolute. The rum is rich and almost chocolatey in its booziness at first, but this fades quite quickly, leaving a cozy, toasted mÃ©lange of oaky tobacco and dried fruit to linger on the skin. In other words, people will think just that you smell deliciously cozy and ”˜warm', rather than suspecting you've been drinking. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar – and Cigar Rum just smells good."," raisin, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peau d'Ambre Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the stone vases and leather gourds used to transport fragrant resins and scented oils in ancient Corinth, Peau d'Ambre is the latest reminder that Pierre Guillaume is a master of striking skin scents. Utilizing a subtle yet powerful palette of materials that would have been familiar in the 6th century BCE Mediterranean- warm, sweet resin, woodsy, sappy balsam, and smoky, silver frankincense- Guillaume weaves a tapestry of sophisticated, understated heat that radiates off skin without shouting, all atop a base of crystalline amber and aged, hardened leather. While its design is never meant to overwhelm, the resinous warmth is distinctive and long lasting, making it perfect to cut through the winter cold, yet still subtle enough for summer heat- not to mention an ideal candidate to layer balsamic depth beneath any scent of your choosing."," Frankincense, fir balsam, opoponax, benzoin, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34556.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau A La Rose Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," The beauty of Francis Kurkdjian's A La Rose is beyond reproach. Since its 2014 launch, fragrance lovers worldwide have fallen head over heels for its vibrantly romantic bouquet of French and Bulgarian roses, kissed with a youthful touch of fruit and musk. In fact, it's such an iconic niche scent that any follow-up or flanker would have to be something quite special indeed. Luckily, L'eau A La Rose is a sheer delight- the lush beauty of A La Rose in an eau de toilette of surprising sillage and depth, along with a mouthwatering arrangement of ripe fruits- lychee and pear- that take a timeless classic and make it feel modern, sexy, and fun. Anyone afraid that the rose doesn't stand out as much in EDT form need not worry, either- Kurkdjian nearly doubled the proportion of rose oil in the formula, giving L'eau A La Rose astounding performance for the concentration and more than living up to the lofty standards of the original. Whether you already love A La Rose and are looking for a fresher, brighter companion scent, or if you simply want to expand your collection to include a truly crowd-pleasing floral, you won't want to miss L'eau A La Rose."," Lychee, pear, rose, peony, violet, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49889.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Prick Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Flesh. Petals. Thorns.Inspired by Tom Ford's private rose garden, Rose Prick is a wild bouquet of beautiful breeds of rose–Rose de Mai, Turkish and Bulgarian. Sharp and pristine, the piercing prickles of the stems hook onto each other, bonding their blooms in pink perfection. A rose by any other name wouldn't be Tom Ford. What We Think Gently candied with a tingling spice, this delectable rose scent has both a provocative and youthful edge."," Bulgarian rose, turmeric extract, Indonesian patchouli, sichuan pepper, roasted tonka, tolu balsam Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Rose Prick by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

20 20 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Berlin, 1920: the global excess of the Roaring Twenties is in full swing. Artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of New York, London, and Paris. And in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- CHIC, from J.F. Schwarzlose & SÃ¶hne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable German ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a Roaring Twenties of our own, J.F. Schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of CHIC with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes. The result is vintage floral elegance buoyed by a modern, irreverent buzz of woodsy energy- a fragrance both timeless and contemporary, with an indomitable spirit of creative expression and joie de vivre. It's impossible to say what the next decade may hold, but with 20|20, we can at least ring in the '20s in style."," Rose, benzoin, patchouli, amber woods, pink pepper, geranium",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Angelys Pear Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," For Patricia de Nicolai, nature is the ultimate inspiration. And few fragrances are quite as regal, as inspiring, as downright mouthwatering as the pear. Since its introduction to Europe from Asia during Roman times, this uniquely complex fruit has been treasured, considered a ""fruit of the castle"" and a sign of high social distinction. It's this inspiration, specifically as it relates to the Loire Valley of France, where both delicious pears and great castles abound, that serves as the focus of Angelys Pear, named for both the Loire city of Angers, and the lys, the symbolic flower of French kings.And the scent itself? A divinely sweet and juicy pear note, enhanced by a bouquet of rose and jasmine, highlighted by invigorating oakmoss that suggests a hint of a classical chypre. Ephemeral and serene, full of purity, light, and calm, this eau de toilette perfectly illustrates the fabled bounty of the Loire Valley."," Bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313061.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ligno Extrait de Parfum,Jeroboam," When the devilish patchouli meets the pheromonal grey amber... the result is beyond a perfume, it becomes an alchemists' potion with an aphrodisiacal promise. In Vanina Muracciole's creation, Ligno is a woody extract with Amber at its heart, wrapped by the signature enigmatic musks that gives an unapparelled volume to each Jeroboam perfume."," Bergamot, Sage, Saffron, Cistus , Grey Amber, Fir Balsam, Rose Essence, Tonka Bean, Patchouli, Enigmatic Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/714011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unnamed Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," One can't deny that Unnamed got people talking. Not just about this nameless perfume, but about how we all use note lists to help us form an idea of the smell. Let's close our eyes for a moment, breathe it in, and let our nose lead the way...Brrrrrr... cold. We smell the gin-and-tonic snap of juniper berry, and the cold, rooty gleam of orris. The texture is peppery, silvery, and transparent, like a light mist curling around the trees in a Northern fir forest. There is also a mysterious red berry note weaving in and out – an ice-covered raspberry that adds a dollop of deliciousness. Damp lichen and moss add an inky, forest tone to the scent-- creating a gloomy but captivating atmosphere. Only one thing is certain: You get to call this heavenly fragrance any name you wish."," Gin accord, pink pepper, orris root, violet, tree moss, fir balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hongkong Oolong Eau de Parfum,NEZ,"Hongkong Oolong captures the image of China as I see it in a few years, with its contrasts and modernity. This fragrance juxtaposes my interpretation of tea with the specificity of oolong. Designing a fragrance is always about adapting reality. I thought about what it is in tea that gives pleasure and comfort. So, I built the composition around musky notes, which reveal themselves generously, like the long finish you get with a mature tea. Spicy inflections of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger reproduce the warming effect of a hearty mouthful. A base of sandalwood and tonka bean round off the accord with a milky sweetness. Then, I incorporated the specific characteristics of oolong and that floral lightness; jasmine, honeysuckle, with its fruity and honeyed accents, and a touch of magnolia, which I associate iwth China. Lastly, hints of leather, incense and moss transform the green, vegetal freshness of the tea leaf to bring out its fermented character.","Tea, Oolong, Musk, Spicy, Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamom, Ginger, Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Sweet, Milky, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Fruity, Honey, Magnolia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/770016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salted Green Mango Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Salted Green Mango is utterly unique, and dare we say it, one of Strangers Parfumerie's best. There are green fragrances, there are sour fragrances, there are dry fragrances -  Salted Green Mango manages to be all of the above, but with an otherworldly, exotic flair that defies description. Ostensibly an ode to Bao mango, a green, tart mango native to the  Southern part of Thailand, where perfumer Prin Lomros was born and raised, there is nothing really sweet or juicy about the fruit note here. Instead, the mango is a thing of rare, desiccated beauty - a dark green rind dipped in sea salt that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth only to think of it.Why would this be refreshing or appetizing? We don't know, but it just is. Salted Green Mango is a green fruit devoid of sweetness, moisture, or sparkle – instead, it draws us into the shadows of a mineral vetiver and the pleasant bitterness of inedible fruit that is all rind and pith. Salted Green Mango is the crawlspace where we find the coolness and repose we crave in the hottest of weather."," green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SM Cafe Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," SM CafÃ© is half cafÃ©, half sado-masochism. An erotic coffee shop, as perfumer Prin Lomros playfully points out. Yes, it does sound rather dirty ”” but honestly ”” SM CafÃ© is nowhere near as scandalous as it sounds. Put your misgivings to one side, for SM CafÃ© is simply the glorious coming together of a delicious, aromatic fresh-roasted coffee aroma and a smoky boot leather aroma. Think AomassaÃ¯ or Coze (Parfumerie Generale) on steroids. We smell two distinct and entrancing accords here – the first, a pure espresso darkness mingling with a sweet and creamy waffle cone note, which conjures up the realistic aroma of a cafÃ© ambiance, and second, the smoky, woody scent of freshly-waxed leather boots. Naughty or just nice? Wear it and decide for yourself. We think it's one of the all-time coffee greats."," coffee absolute, Russian leather, suede, Javanol, lavender, amber, benzoin, tobacco, cade, Atlas cedarwood, tonka bean, beeswax absolute, maraschino cherry, patchouli, cashmeran, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aroon Sawat Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Aroon Sawat, meaning“good morning!” in Thai, is part of Strangers Parfumerie's 24/7 series. Inspired by the gentle warmth of the morning sun, the scent was composed by perfumer Prin Lomros with the specific intent of capturing all the golden tones implied in the country's original name of Siam, which is thought to have originated in the word Suvannaphumi, meaning Land of Gold.And indeed, Aroon Sawat is a perfume rich in warm, ambered notes that seem to shimmer like particles of gold dust caught in sunlight. Thick, syrupy plums, mango, and ripe passionfruit are suspended in multiple layers of hazy woods, ambers, and resins for a smoky incense effect that lingers all day. Think plumes of rich myrrh and sandalwood incense pouring out of an ancient Thai temple and mingling with the heady scent of ripe stone fruits and white flowers in nearby orchards. Yet, in the midst of all these rich, smoky aromas, there is a thread of freshness – from the citrus, or the sour mango – that cuts through the velveteen texture of the scent and allows air to circulate. It's divine. And if you love woody-ambery-leathery scents such as Costume National or Ombre Indigo (or even Chambre Noir) by Olfactive Studio, then Aroon Sawat could scratch the same itch."," golden mango, Marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Burning Ben Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Burning Ben belongs to Prin Lomros' LGBTQ series, and was inspired by a subtle moment in the South Korean movie   ""Burning” where the“Ben” character struggles with a conversation that might be interpreted as homophobic, dredging up a host of complex feelings in himself. Burning Ben is a stunning phenolic scent that similarly unites all sorts of opposing elements – hazelnut, beeswax, burning tires, leather, and forest fruit – creating a surprisingly harmonious and“complete” whole, just like the conflicted humanity of Ben.Burning Ben opens with a hugely realistic shot of espresso, with the dark, roasted flavor of beans brought perhaps a hair too far to burning point. Doused in a black, almost chewy sweet, spicy smoke, it feels like walking through the aftermath of a fire. But fear not, for the smoke clears and lifts in places, revealing intriguing hints of nuts, berries, saffron, and plums, notes that lend the austere smoke a gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness. A caramelized-butter amber, incense, and beeswax tandem shore all of this up from the basenotes, for a complex and rich finish that dawdles pleasurably between sweet, smoky, spicy, and sandalwoody without alighting completely on one or the other. If you love phenolic scents such as The Black Knight by Francesca Bianchi or T-Rex by Zoologist but want something softer and subtler for daytime wear, then Burning Ben could be for you."," hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, Javanol, saffron, burning tire",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cigar Rum Intense Extrait de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," If you loved the original Cigar Rum but longed for more heft, more richness....more everything – then the Extrait version, Cigar Rum Intense, is for you. Sculpting the original's bright, punchy booze-and-tobacco into a new and more mature direction, Cigar Rum Intense leans on a dark, resinous coffee absolute, a dash of cinnamon, and a strong  aquatic note to mark itself out as a different animal. Compared to its predecessor, Cigar Rum Intense is altogether a more muscular affair, an injection of briny radiance lifting and hoisting the richly spicy tobacco, booze, and dried fruit accords over the last mile. It lasts forever. Surprisingly, Cigar Rum Intense also smells fresher; a rugged, outdoorsy version of the casual island bar vibe of the original. In the far drydown, a gorgeously silky, masculine-leaning musk emerges, shot thrown by the spicy ”˜bay rum' bitterness of copaiba, a greenish-gold tree resin native to Brazil. While Cigar Rum is for the young buck, let's say that Cigar Rum Intense is for the man (or woman) who has arrived at the top and isn't afraid to signal it."," raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oliver Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Oliver is an original take on the aromatic herbs and citrus freshness of the traditional eau de cologne. At first, you smell the bright, tart (and always oddly dry) burst of citrus notes of the classic Farina or 4177, with their cleansing and pure aroma designed by nature to awaken and refresh the senses, supported by the crisp, herbal undergrowth of basil leaf, clary sage, and cool, green cypresses. But as the more volatile aromatic notes burn off, you notice some subtly non-traditional notes in the background. There is the musky scent of a man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly from his warm body, introducing a beautifully intimate and human tone (we suspect the glowy magic of ambrette seed and ambergris to be the responsible parties here). Then there is the exciting tang of sea salt, the dry rosy leather of quince, the incensey bitterness of oakmoss, and the powdered plushness of triple-milled French iris soap. Oliver feels personal. It's far more evolved than it ought to be, for all its eau de cologne inspiration. It makes sense to us that this raspy, oddball freshie was inspired by the bittersweet love story of two young men on the cusp between childhood and adulthood in the acclaimed indie movie Call Me by Your Name."," bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lumberjack Cologne Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Lumberjack Cologne smells exactly as advertized – a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! Prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a North American lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. As he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. There is a flash of bitter citrus and Scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. Lumberjack Cologne just smells great – a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. And that is what Lumberjack Cologne is."," lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sangre Dulce Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Sangre Dulce is a weird and yet completely wearable gourmand idea born out of Prin Lomros' love for two specific movies. The ”˜sangre' part of the title, meaning blood (or family ties), represents the crazy lifestyle and mores of the strange religious cult in Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre, and the ”˜dulce' part (sweet) comes from the lurid hallucinations experienced by party goers upon ingesting a cocktail laced with LSD  in the French movie ""Climax"" by Gaspar NoÃ©. Based on the inspiration, we expect an oddball mixture of sweet and inedible elements that have been thrown together in a somewhat wild and unconventional manner. And that is exactly what we get! A wild pinprick burst of woodland strawberries, technicolor in their juicy sweetness, imploding over and over again in a beescomb, their pulpy scent muffled by a molten pour of pure gold honey. But there is also a softly musky tobacco-ish accord, shot through with rosewater marshmallow fluff, and buttery ylang sharpened to a spike with blood orange. It is both sweet and not sweet, edible and firmly inedible, all at once. The balance here is superb, refining a cornucopia of fruits, burnt sugar, and balsams to a slim and elegant peak that is unusual in the gourmand genre. Consider us astonished and delighted!"," sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang ylang, benzoin, Peru balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandarava Extrait de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Inspired by the vision of sweet yellow flowers, white elephants, and towering mountain peaks that make up the Thai vision of Trayastrimsa – the Buddhist Nirvana or Afterlife - Mandarava is perfumer Prin Lomros' interpretation of what heaven smells like. At first, heaven smells like a lei of heady tropical flowers laid around your neck, the lushness of ripe jasmine, rice pudding-esque champaca, and buttery, banana-rich ylang sending the senses reeling. There is an impression of red fruit swollen with juices, threatening to burst out of the pollen-soaked flowers and run down your arm uninterrupted. But this is no innocent, girlish affair. Mandarava shows us that flowers can be downright filthy when they want to be. The lasciviousness of the Hindi oud couples furiously with a sharp civet and earthy cumin to lend the floral bouquet a spicy animalic edge that seems lifted out of 1980s powerhouse canon, before the reformulation bug bit. Now envisage this dense, spicy floral knot being lifted and diffused by a clean, powdery nag champa musk and soft incense ash, wafting in and out of the animalic floral oud notes to breathe air into the composition. After smelling both Ma Nishtana and Mandarava, we are calling Prin Lomros the Master of the Eastern incense theme in perfumery, hands down."," bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, Himalayan champaca, Madagascar ylang ylang, Indian marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, Mysore sandalwood, Assamese oud (Hindi), Indonesian patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, Siamese benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ma Nishtana Extrait de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Ma Nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""Why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of Had Gadya (the Chava Alberstein version). In a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask,“why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?”. After all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. Well, Ma Nishtana is something special.Standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of Comme des Garcons' Avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of Grimoire by Anatole LeBreton, Ma Nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. Instead, it is both, all at once. Its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. There is incense – mixed incense resins rather than any single one – smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of ”˜Buddhist temple'-like mysticism. But there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. Austerity balanced by comfort. If you're on an incense quest, then Ma Nishtana might just be your final destination."," saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, Norlimbanol, clove, allspice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thichila Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the Eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic Thai herbs and spices. Either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm.  The composition of Thichila is a marvel. Although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic Thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of Wan Sao Lhong - a traditional Thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - Thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. An unctuous combo of champaca flower and Indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. But blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that Siam oud. In Thai folklore, Wan Sao Lhong is feted as a love potion. And while Thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted – drunk on this Thai love potion."," saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, Indian tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, Thai oud, Mysore sandalwood, Indonesian vetiver, cinnamon bark, Wan Sao Lhong ( Amomum Biflorum Jack)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohragot Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Mohragot, meaning“emerald” in Thai, is an aromatic, muscular masculine that draws on the classical European fougÃ¨re for structure but twists it in a distinctly Eastern direction for a scent that will surprise and delight even the most jaded of palates. Exotic touches such as earthy betel leaf, milky-green-sweet pandan leaf, and dusty, tobacco-ish chalood bark – all materials indigenous to South East Asian countries such as Thailand and India – make it clear that, although we can smell the inky bitterness of oakmoss and the dark green herbal undergrowth of the classic European forest shifting underneath, we are in unfamiliar territory. And it's a thrilling realization.Thus, in the place of dewy ferns and bright lavender, we smell the damp, reddish soil of the Thai jungle, which mingles with the chewy, green perfumeyness of sweet pandan leaves to create a deeply green, spicy aroma that soothes and excites all at once. In the base, Thai oud joins with a flinty, minty oakmoss and the coumarin-like nuances of chalood bark for a finish that is softly musky and woodsy, gently disengaging the scent from its aromatic topnotes. For those who love the classical fougÃ¨re genre but wish it were a bit more innovative or exotic, Mohragot should be on your test list."," betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, Thai oud, sandalwood, Thai vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tiwa Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Tiwa, Thai for“daytime”, is a radiant floral citrus scent that represents“the scents of home” for perfumer Prin Lomros, conjuring up the aromatic, fresh scent of local herbs being simmered in a pot by neighbors, nearby citrus orchards, and the lingering smoke of precious woods being dried in sheds. Tiwa belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Tiwa is a beautifully fresh, herbal take on the traditional citrus eau de cologne idea. The herbs in the opening are undeniably exotic, with a mouthwateringly savory, minty Thai basil duking it out with sour kaffir lime, spicy finger root oil, and an earthy green celery seed. The bright, tart citrus notes play second fiddle to the herbs for a while, but eventually jostle their way to the front, for an effect that is akin to Diorella or Eau Sauvage covered in verdant Thai foliage. The herbaciousness dies back eventually to reveal a rich, soapy orange blossom freshness that lingers on the skin for hours, like the warmth of a late afternoon sun. Fresh, tart, and rich, Tiwa is an upgrade on the eau de cologne theme that you'd be crazy to miss out on.Made with 100% Natural materials"," tangerine, kaffir limes, orange flower absolute, petitgrain, holy basil, cananga, finger root oil, Indonesian patchouli, guava leaf, lime, celery seed, vetiver, Australian sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tom Yum Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Oh boy – just say the word Tom Yum and our mouths water. And the perfume Tom Yum has precisely the same effect. Spritz it on and your senses are instantly afire. Inspired by the famously sweet and sour Tom Yum soup of Thailand, Tom Yum (the scent) belongs to Prissana's Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, meaning that it is all natural – more a recipe than a formula, almost. An extra inducement to lick your own skin when you're wearing it.Tom Yum smells immediately like a steaming hot bowl of Tom Yum. Exploding with bright, citrusy lemongrass and coriander flavors, it is a perfect balance of hot, sweet, sour, and herbal. The flavors seem to go 1,000 leagues deep in each direction. The gingery heat of galangal is cooled by the soapy, lemony grassiness of coriander for a sensory experience that feels invigorating and exciting. Keeping all these explosive herbal and citrus notes in check is a backing of nutty, smoky chalood bark, and a soft sigh's worth of jasmine. Wonderful for a hot summer's day, when a dramatic twist on the traditional eau de cologne-style refreshment is called for.Made with 100% natural materials"," Lime, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, petitgrain, jasmine absolute, galangal, coriander, patchouli, grapefruit, lemon, chalood bark",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Natsumeku Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Natsumeku is the Japanese word for the start of the summer and is inspired by the pleasant memory of a day perfumer Prin Lomros spent wandering around the Japanese countryside on a bright, cloudless spring day. Belonging to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, Natsumeku is composed of 100% all-natural raw materials. Natsumeku is pure sunshine in a bottle. Imagine an entire Japanese yuzu tree – the variety of citrus native to Japan – pulped, distilled, and poured into a small clear bottle, and that is what it smells like. The traditional woods of Japan – silvery hinoki wood and green, minty-rosy camphor – form the subtle backing to the main players, which are the stunning liquid sunshine of yuzu (both the peel and the fruit), the dark green leaves clustered around the fruit (neroli), and the bittersweet lime twang of bergamot. Being all natural, this joyful explosion of multi-faceted citrus fruits cannot last forever, but the perfumer has cleverly extended the citrus loveliness as far as he can by way of a classically clean, soapy neroli accord that seems to go on forever.Made with 100% Natural materials"," camphor, yuzu, hinoki, orange bitter, mandarin, lavender, neroli, orris butter, rose otto, oakmoss, artemisia, bergamot, tangerine, palo santo",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maruyama Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana," Maruyama, the name of a Japanese mountain, is a scent inspired by a visit made by perfumer Prin Lomros to a herb and flower garden in Sapporo, Hokkaido Japan, an island famous for its incredible diversity of rare medicinal herbs and flowers native to Japan. Using a natural and rare blue chamomile that tints the liquid an unusual blue hue*, Maruyama belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Maruyama is a rich, savory-herbal woody scent teeming with the surprising aromas of freshly roast coffee beans, caramelized brown sugar, amber, and celery root – notes that cannot be explained by the notes list. Rather, this is alchemic magic worked by the combination of unusual materials such as lovage root and blue chamomile, herbal notes that have an odd, unexpected richness and dimension to them. Quirky and entrancing, this chorus of ”˜brown', sweetly aromatic notes proves to be robust, lasting throughout the day until the vegetal muskiness of ambrette seed diffuses it all out into a soft, woodsy haze. If you are fond of rich but kind of weird, offbeat herbal or woody perfumes such as Comme des Garcons' Sequoia, then Maruyama is for you.Made with 100% Natural materials*Please note that due to Maruyama's all-natural ingredients, the fragrance may change color to a dark grey/purple. This is perfectly normal and does not affect the scent itself."," chamomile, camphor, artemisia, marjoram, incense, rose otto, angelica, jatamansi, amyris, ambrette seed, cedarwood, vetiver, lovage  root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
If by RK Eau de Parfum,Frapin," ""If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you...""So begins Rudyard Kipling's legendary poem, which, for all the striking and undeniable faults of the author, has endured to become a paean to lives lived with clear eyes and gusto, lives where, to paraphrase Kipling, Triumph and Disaster are two imposters to be treated just the same. Inspired by his grandfather's spirited retelling of the poem, Frapin artistic director David Frossard was traveling south down the Indian coast when he was struck with the desire to create a scent dedicated to travel, adventure, self-discovery, and constant personal improvement. The scent itself is a dashingly spicy masculine that whisks us across the subcontinent with fiery pepper from Karnataka igniting a heady dose of ginger and cinnamon, before balancing it out with a cool, milky fig. At the intersection of spicy and creamy is the main ingredient, precious sandalwood from Mysore, the finest in the world, which finds robust partners in a base of Indonesian patchouli, Peruvian guaiac, and Venezuelan tonka- a rich, smooth, powerful combination for any man ready to seize his destiny. Make no mistake- Kipling himself was not, by any means, a role model. But If by RK transcends the flaws of the man to capture the core of why his words have remained so firmly etched in the public consciousness for all these years."," Ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc Moschus Eau De Parfum,Rania J.," What makes a perfect winter musk scent? For us, it's a fragrance that can balance the deep, sensual aspects of musk with its fresher, brighter aspects to create something both comforting and stylish- in other words, a scent that wears as well on a bright, clear winter morning as it does in the middle of a blizzard. And Musc Moschus nails this balancing act perfectly- warm yet bright, sweet yet gentle, it's the kind of effortlessly beautiful musk scent that can take the edge off the chilliest day, but won't overwhelm even when you're right next to the fireplace. The secret is the interplay between the strong, lovely base of white musk- at once both smooth and warm- and a strikingly lovely sweet and fruity opening- tart berries and juicy blackcurrant with just the right touch of sugar to feel festive but fresh. Creamy sandalwood and vanilla enhance the richness of the musk, and a perfect touch of iris adds sophistication and depth. It's the perfect scent to carry you through family gatherings and new-year adventures alike. In fact, there's really only one drawback- like winter itself, Musc Moschus is a limited edition that won't be available once 2020 rolls around, so don't miss your opportunity to get a bottle."," Bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
War and Peace II Extrait de Parfum,Areej Le Dore," War and Peace II is an olfactory battle of life and death, where precious aromatics that are complete opposites clash and then infuse into one another, finding balance and harmony.In the opening, the composition explodes with a smoky incense represented by Himalayan fossilized amber resin over 35 million years old. This prehistoric substance was dry distilled, allowing it to break and release its ancient spirit. These deep anddark incensy notes layer with one of the softest aromatics known to man: rose. Leathery, balsamic, slightly piney resin incense lays atop the freshly distilled virgin soul of Indian rose: Ruh Gulab, one of the most precious oils in India. A soft, silky rose cloud, covered in ancient black smoke, a flawless marriage of darkness and light.Powdery and sticky sweet orris root absolute supports the rose, pulling it into the heart, where aged and soothing, chocolaty patchouli awaits. Warm, sensual orris root absolute in combination with Ruh Gulab conveys the feelings of peace and glory, and brings a burst of life into the composition.Suddenly, everything that came before is swallowed by the power of nuclear, natural musks. Thick, dark waves of salty ambergris, furry deer musk and dirty black leather of castoreum, co-extracted all together by Russian Adam, create a sensation of loud, struggling, deadly war. Animalics take over, capturing and captivating everything along the way. Wild, ferocious currents of civet take the invasion to an even deeper level. Wafts of smoky amber return to the scene, coupled with one of the most leathery, dirty vetivers, creating a bold, olfactory drama. And when the spectacular aromatic battle has finally mellowed, dry and heavy animalic leather remains to dominate at the base; intense and regal, smooth and sensual, leather that lasts for hours and hours...Here we have faced a juxtaposition of black and white, of life and death, and through it all, we discover in this calmly aggressive composition a harmonious balance. This olfactory poem, War and Peace, will satisfy even the most adventurous fragrance lover.Version II has been updated with ""more refinement"" to the ingredients and structure of the fragrance specifically the patchouli and orris root","Amber Resin, Smoky Incense, Rose, Leathery, Balsamic, Chocolaty, Patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/784021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ummo Eau de Parfum,Xinu," Ummo is a tribute to tobacco, one of the most representative and symbolic plants of the American continent. The smoke given off by the dried leaves of tobacco is considered sacred and has been used for spiritual rituals, healing, and purification ceremonies since long before European commodification made the plant synonymous with indulgence and bad habits. It's this older, purer expression of tobacco that makes Ummo such a uniquely potent and spiritual experience- as rich and spicy as any tobacco scent, but with a gorgeously naturalistic green floral character, enhanced with fresh jasmine tobacco flowers and the sweet resinousness of styrax. A warm but bright tonka and cedar base manages to feel both ethereal and comforting, establishing Ummo as a uniquely soulful tobacco scent, and a welcome addition to Xinu's already impressive lineup."," Virginia tobacco, Jasmine tobacco, Styrax, Tonka bean, Juniper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/786005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
What About Pop Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," A great gourmand fragrance is meant to stimulate not only your tastebuds, but also your spirit- to provide a wonderful moment stolen away from the demands and burdens of everyday life. And while decadent confections and many-tiered cakes may be the stuff of fairytales, sometimes the most memorable indulgences in real life are as simple as a mouthwatering handful of caramel popcorn. That's the pleasure of What About Pop, a delectable new gourmand built around a perfect note of salted, buttery, caramel-enveloped popcorn. Sweet and savory, this arresting accord is softened with a unique Lunar Flower, enriched with a velvety milk cream, and delicately placed atop a deeply sensual base of woodsy vanilla. It's a gourmand scent as rewardingly unique as it is delicious, a perfect treat for lovers of all sweets, but especially those who find the sweet and salty crunch of caramel corn to be the world's most perfect snack. Take a break from everyday life with What About Pop, and feel your cares melt away."," Salty popcorn, Hawthorn, Caramel, Lunar flower, Milk cream, ExaVanilla, Amber, Ebony, Vetyver, Benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/764027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dendera Extrait de Parfum,Centauri Perfumes," Dendera is inspired by the great ancient Egyptian civilization and the mystery and immense beauty they left behind. The Dendera complex itself is a unique temple, famous for its“Dendera Lightbulbs” and built upon a much older temple complex newly discovered beneath its floors. The top notes open with rich spices, cinnamon and nutmeg for a  warm and inviting beginning. A resinous natural incense accord built upon frankincense and myrrh continues to entice as the scent starts to dry down. The natural Moroccan orris butter has a dry dusty tonality with a gently sweet Rooibos tea like quality. The combination of the orris with the earthy Vietnamese oud is a beautifully dry and rich accord reminiscent of Egyptian desert sands. As it dries down through the resinous incense base a creamy Indian sandalwood comes through, becoming softly coated in a sparkling fine musky white ambergris, a touch of vanilla adds a hint of sweetness. Designed to be a scent fit for a Pharaoh and inspired by their legacy."," Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Orris Butter, Bulgarian Rose Absolute, Frankincense, Myrrh, Labdanum, East Indian Sandalwood, Vietnamese Oud, Haitian Vetiver, Madagascan Vanilla Absolute & White Ambergris Tincture.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/841000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gaea Eau de Parfum,Centauri Perfumes," Gaea, named after Mother Earth, is a harmony of many elements working together as one, just as the many aspects of nature create an overall unity.The scent starts off amongst a lush forest and opens up with a green leaf accord combined with wormwood that creates a unique and slightly unusual herbal introduction that bringing you right to the edge of the forest. As it starts to progress, the floral notes start to softly emerge. A smooth white tuberose nuanced by rose, lavender and orris starts to come through. A dark honey emerges at the same time coating the florals in a deliciously soft sweetness.The dry down stays close to the skin like a sensual aura of ambrette musk, ambergris, and honey. In the background an earthy patchouli lingers on, reminding you of the forest from where you started the journey."," Green Leaves, Dry Earth, Honey, Tuberose, Rose, Lavender, Orris Butter, Apple, Cedarwood, Wormwood, Patchouli, Ambrette Musk, & Ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/841001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mile High Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Immortelle flowers don't get their name by accident- these lusciously sweet-smelling members of the Helichrysum family blossom in places lesser florals fear to tread. It's both their intoxicating aroma and their striking fortitude that inspire Mile High, a dynamic, sexy, modern unisex fragrance dedicated to those who thrive no matter what challenges life has to offer. It's only appropriate that the immortelle absolute that animates the heart of Mile High hails from Corsica, an island renowned for its rugged beauty. Sweet and earthy with a hint of spice, it pairs perfectly with a juicy, sharp, gently smoky pineapple note to create a stunning unisex profile that feels fresh, substantial, and undeniably seductive. Combined with the sensual depth of Venezuelan tonka bean and Indonesian patchouli, and we realize that the other connotation of Mile High hasn't been lost on Parle Moi- this is seriously sexy stuff. Like the immortelle itself, we suspect Mile High is going to be thriving for years to come.Mile High is an exclusive creation for Luckyscent & Scent Bar."," Immortelle, tonka, patchouli, pineapple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Keeps you smelling of old school refinement and freshness all day long. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, the Milano Cento Him fragrance opens with sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart."," Lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, lavender, rosemary, basil, clary sage, sandalwood, patchouli, clove, cinnamon, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/823002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Telegrama Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors," Aboard a transatlantic flight many years after an intense but short-lived meeting, two Argentinean lovers are serendipitously united- but the repercussions of this much-anticipated convergence could have global consequences.Inspired by the glamour of first class in the golden age of air travel, Telegrama is a stylishly comfortable, seductively refined fragrance that has us yearning for the good old days. Presented in the style of classic masculine scents of the '60s, it's a plush, clean, retro-cool fragrance so comfortable and easy to wear that it just may become your new daily go-to. The opening is instantly enchanting, with the classically sharp tone of lavender enhanced with fiery black pepper and smooth talc, before leading into a warm heart of polished woods that evokes the opulently appointed cabins of a luxurious mid-century aircraft. And to complete the illusion, a smooth, comfortable base of powdery vanilla and fresh linen lends a deft richness, complex but appropriately light for a fragrance inspired by air travel. It's a classic but refreshing scent, universally wearable despite the masculine inspiration, and simply, inarguably, well, good. Try it today and make a connection of your very own."," Talc, lavender, black pepper, teak, amyris, vanilla powder, fresh linen",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Koiame Eau de Parfum,J-Scent," With a motif of ""rain, "" this scent evokes loving memories carved into the heart. The top note is a faint aroma of mandarin and cassis that mimics the scent of petrichor that precedes the rain. A heart of whispering violet and magnolia evokes the subtle way that rainfall quietly awakens the outside world. Finally,  in the mossy,  musky base,  we feel the soft and comforting joy one can find in a rainbow,  shimmering in the sky as the clouds part."," Apple, peach, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, cassis, green notes, rose, jasmine, magnolia, violet, water lily, musk, cedar, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hakka Eau de Parfum,J-Scent," A delicate and refreshing scent that wears crisp and gentle. Hakka opens with cool, transparent mint (the menthol infusing your skin with a noticeable cooling effect), before introducing the subtly sweet aroma of jasmine and lilies. A breezy, smooth base further adds to the composition with fresh iris and clean white musk- the perfect fragrance for those who want to avoid even a hint of heaviness."," Bergamot, mint, green leaves, jasmine, lily, iris, lotus, musk, amber, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Divine Vanille Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," When you have a raw material as glorious as vanilla absolute from Madagascar, the smart thing to do is to let it shine. And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.This clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity. Divine Vanille is mysterious, yet easy to read - the perfect balance between simple and complex."," Clary sage, cinnamon, black pepper, osmanthus, incense, pomarose, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, cedar, musk, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acqua di Scandola Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Every single molecule in Acqua di Scandola reflects Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's love for Corsica and its wild, windswept beauty. Inspired by the eponymous Scandola, a tiny rocky outcrop of an island just off the Corsican coastline that can only be accessed by the sea, Acqua di Scandola is an unusual aquatic for two reasons. First, it conjures the natural scent of sea air without losing ground to the sweet, melony aromachemicals that ruin other aquatics. Second, Acqua di Scandola encapsulates not only the sea surrounding the island, but also the wild herbs, algae, aromatics, and grasses that cling to the rocks of the island itself.   We don't see it listed in the notes, but we smell a lot of citrus in the opening. In fact, it's as if Marc-Antoine Corticchiato borrowed the thrillingly bitter orange note from Azemour Les Orangers or the yuzu from Yuzu Fou, rubbed enough sea salt into its peel to make it crackle, and simply set it into a bed of algae, moss, and lichen. This citrus-in-a-sea-breeze accord is both natural-smelling and durable, occupying most of the scent's trajectory from top to bottom. But in the background, a textured mÃ©lange of garrigue herbs and grasses adds subtle warmth that reminds us of salt-kissed skin, hay, and minerals evaporating under the sun. Incredibly invigorating and lung-expanding, Acqua di Scandola is the rare aquatic that will really make you feel like you're on or near the sea itself, rather than in a chemical-driven fantasy of the real thing."," algae extract, juniper, immortelle, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bee Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," We don't usually play favorites. We love all of our perfumes, and their creators, equally. Trust us, we really do. But when a perfume comes along that's such a unanimous hit with Luckyscent staff, then we feel obliged to mention it. Bee is just irresistible! Opening with a luscious, jellied orange and a smattering of meadow flowers, the honey accord is both extremely realistic and un-animalic – a rare feat that makes Bee a real contender for the title of the baby bear's porridge of the honey fragrance genre. Set deep in a bombastic surround system of glittering amber and incense, the quietly golden floral honey center is magnified and broadcast until it fills the room, creating an incredible sillage that trails after you like the waves made by the Titanic. Though enormously rich and deep, the honey draws upon a doughy beeswax note to muffle its sweetness, and a softly musky, woody base of sandalwood and benzoin to keep it from sliding off into honey's more animalic facets. Honey is such a difficult note to do well – and, in our opinion, Bee is an unmitigated triumph. If you love, the honeyed, ambery warmth of scents such as Botrytis (but could do without the booze and grape must), then this gorgeous scent by Zoologist could be the Bee in your bonnet (sorry)."," orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musks, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Majaina Sin Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," Rich, sweet, and deeply comforting, Majaina Sin proves that The Different Company can do indulgence with every bit as much panache as they famously do freshness. Constructed around a prized specimen of Bourbon Vanilla from Madagascar named Vanilla Gold Extract for its sophisticated and smooth nuance (the product of painstaking hand pollination and careful aging), its intoxicating blend of spicy, sweet, and creamy notes is sure to seduce and delight in equal measure. As a tribute to the unspoiled beauty of Madagascar, Majaina Sin doesn't stop at the vanilla, as the strikingly fiery supporting notes of ginger and cinnamon are also harvested from the island, infusing the smooth, sweet white floral heart with a jolt of passion and energy that balance the mouthwatering sugared orange, chestnut cream, and maple syrup. The result is a scent that truly has something for everyone, an oriental gourmand that won't leave fans of either style wanting. Take a journey to Madagascar with Majaina Sin- we don't blame you if you never want to come back."," Candied orange, bigarade, bergamot, neroli, orange blossom, ginger, heliotrope, orchid, chestnut cream, cinnamon, maple syrup, tonka, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25343.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Meraki Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, Shisedo's long discontinued Nombre Noir. Envisioned as the Japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary Serge Lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to Shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. But a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than Luca Turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""When creating Meraki, Rasei Fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of Nombre Noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. However, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate Osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. It's a tribute to what Nombre Noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.And so this is the journey to Meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. Equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable Fort & Manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. It's a perfect Rasei Fort creation, in other words. And given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to Nombre Noir in every way."," Aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is the result of a special collaboration between Ex Nihilo Paris and the French-born visual artist Reine Paradis, who creates narrative photographs and paintings staging herself as the central figure in a transcendent landscape. Reine's work is characterized by abstract swatches of sea blues, greens, and lush tropical colors that plunge the viewer into a semi dream-like state – and this aesthetic has spilled over wholesale into Reine's gorgeous ”˜edit' of Lust in Paradise.Thus, if the original Lust in Paradise is a voyage to the French Riviera by way of a blissful dream, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is a journey to California by way of a Gaugin-esque painting of Tahiti. The original scent's pretty white peony and dewy, fruity lychee gains a new solar dimension by way of the addition of salty, woody ambergris note that creates the impression of sun-warmed skin. Giving the fruit, pink pepper, and pretty florals of the original an expansive, glittering radiance, the ambergris slowly melts down into a sultry woody base that – thanks to the woody-spicy molecule known as Georgywood – adds an even more substantial depth to the original's musky basenotes. Just as pretty and sparkling as the original, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis adds a special something that makes us dream of far-off islands, hypnotic seascapes, sun-drenched skin, and the laid-back feel of Californian artist colonies in California."," pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, Georgywood, ambergris accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/720057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Copper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Fiery red metal, yet cool to the touch. The clarity of contrast. The newest from CDG is a provocative olfactive exploration of perceived differences and harmonious alignment built around another everyday material worthy of re-evaluation: copper. In their inimitable, iconoclastic style, the specifics of copper- the shine, the pliability, the literal electricity- are captured with unique notes- luminous pink pepper berries and juicy blackcurrant settle atop intensely green galbanum and sharp violet leaf, fiery ginger and warm, sweet tobacco clash delightfully against a metallic accord, which itself settles in next to warm, resinous myrrh and smooth vanilla. Is this a photo-perfect capture of the actual smell of copper? Why would it be? Rather, this is the soul of copper, cool but conductive, presented for those with the distinctive style to resonate at the same frequency. Another modern masterpiece from Comme des Garcons."," Pink pepper, galbanum, blackcurrant, ginger, violet leaf, tobacco, metallic notes, amber, vanilla, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Extrait de Parfum,Puredistance," Elegant, chic, unforgettable- the latest Master Perfume from Puredistance is more than worthy of the name Gold. Inspired by a Mondrian-themed Gold, Black and White color palette meant to naturally harmonize with any surrounding, this fragrance finds creator Antoine Lie drawing on a rich trove of golden shaded fragrant materials to create a scent of warm, woodsy elegance- an oriental fragrance with impeccable balance, vintage flair, and a touch of modern chic. Gold opens with invigorating freshness, as juicy green mandarin finds a fiery companion in a bouquet of pink pepper, sweet clove, and aromatic rosemary. A complex heart of florals and even more spices soon follows, the lushness of jasmine absolute charged with a sensual flow of exotic resins and spicy cinnamon that lead into the dreamlike, romantic base of vanilla, tonka, castoreum and myrrh. At Puredistance's indulgent 36% extrait concentration, the scent becomes a veritable feast of the rarest and most precious natural ingredients."," Green Mandarin, Bergamot, Pink peppercorn, Rosemary, Clove buds, Jasmin Absolute, Ciste Absolute, Geranium, Cinnamon, Styrax, Benzoin, Myrrhe, Patchouli, Vanilla Green Beans, Tonka Beans, Castoreum Absolute, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/530023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Atlas Fever Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Inspired by the intoxicatingly woody, incensey scent of the greatest vintage rosewood guitars in history, Atlas Fever combines French niche perfumery know-how with the devil-may-care spirit of rebellion that defines rock n' roll. Its name – a clever twist on the name of its key raw material, Atlas Cedar – is a clue: this scent is not a collection of plain, inert wood but a scent buzzing with a sense of frenetic, barely-contained energy. The opening is fiery and smoldering, a tinder-box cedarwood charged and shot into the air with a burst of hot pink pepper and incense. Incredibly radiant, the oaky tones of the cedar and the smoky-bitter nuances of the gaiac accord billow around the wearer in a thick, spicy brown cloud for a while, before mellowing out into an incredibly lush, creamy surround sound system of real sandalwood, almondy tonka bean, and earthy black vanilla pod. If you love the potently-balsamic, ambery-woody orientals of recent years such as Armani PrivÃ© Myrrhe ImpÃ©riale or Guerlain's Songe d'un Bois en EtÃ©, then you'll love Atlas Fever. Wearing this, there's no doubt you'll make an impression, even surrounded by hundreds of other people at a rock concert."," Pink pepper, incense, narcissus, cedarwood, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla, woody accord (gaiac, oakwood)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Hedonist Absolute Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," One of the most sensuous and beloved niche scents of all time is reborn in the form of an Absolute of rare character. The exhilarating scent of Hedonist Absolute derives its magic from the heady aroma of rich, boozy Jamaican rum blended with lush jasmine and smooth, creamy orange flower. Smoky notes of birch and robustly sweet tobacco couple with lush vanilla to further enhance the depth and mystique of this enchanting creation, still every bit the head-turned as its EDP predecessor, yet rebalanced towards the warmest, richest elements in a way that accentuates its impressive potency and pushes it into impressively unisex territory for men who appreciate the power of sweet, boozy tobacco scent- of course, it's still devastatingly seductive on a woman, as well. Hedonist Absolute is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum. The bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather."," Jamaican rum, jasmine, orange flower, birch, tobacco, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/624006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Iris Absolute Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Reborn as an absolute of unrivalled power and sophistication, Hedonist Iris is a truly one of a kind presentation of this treasured and complex floral. This is an intensely opulent iris, enriched with a touch of sensual suede and leather, all of which comes together beautifully with the warmth of cocoa beans and the classic decadence of ripe vanilla. Light ambery notes and the finest woods bring further depth to this boldly seductive scent, creating an elegant, exquisitely bewitching result.Hedonist Iris Absolute is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum.

Hedonist Rose Absolute Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Hedonist Rose returns in a new and unforgettable form- a scent that strengthens and accentuates the woodsy mysteries of the original for a divine dance between some of the most extravagant ingredients in the world. The lush, romantic power of Turkish rose is still the star player, but now it's complemented with a rare and mysterious oud, smoky, rich, and carnal. Animalic, ambery notes and luxurious sandalwood support the base of this intoxicating oriental, identifying Hedonist Rose as a fragrance of refined quality, but also of carefully restrained seductive power. Presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum.

Patchouli in Perfumery Magazine,NEZ," Once seen as a scent favored by courtesans and hippies, patchouli has become a key ingredient in today's perfumery. Its warm, woody and complex fragrance provides the perfect setting for fresher notes to run free, especially in hte chypre and oriental perfumes.

Le Pavillon d'Or Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Le Pavillon D'Or by Parfums Dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for Thai-born perfumer, Pissara Umavijani. First and foremost, it draws on the Sun Moon lake in Taiwan, where her father, the poet Montri Umavijani (1941-2006), wrote“A Wish”, a poem that reads:“Will I ever have a chance/to sleep by the River of Love/look on the mountain of Long Life/and dip my vision in Sun Moon Lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinement”. But Pissara was also inspired by her love for GuerlÃ©dan Lake in Brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the Aisawan Triphya-Art pavilion in Thailand, a stupendous piece of Thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. Regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of Le Pavillon d'Or. Le Pavillon d'Or is constructed as intricately as a Thai floating pavilion itself. Opening with the crisp, green chill of orris root and mint, the perfume feels immediately cooling; a hot brow soothed by splashes from a mountain stream. The peppery, citrusy nuances of the wild mentha citrata give the opening a fresh, almost classical feel. Soon after, an astonishing fig leaf accord moves into place, managing somehow to be both juicy and dry at the same time. Notes of sweet honeysuckle, boronia, white thyme, and Somalian frankincense render the fig leaf far more interesting than it oughtta be, with tendrils of sweet florals, smoky, and resinous herbal accents creating a heady-but-light whorl of scent. Underneath this all, a divine sandalwood dressed up with a complex, 30-note heliotrope accord give the scent a luxuriantly creamy, almondy base to bed it all down. Both aromatic and warm, Le Pavillon d'Or is a clever series of contrasts wrapped up in a bottle. We think it's as delicately beautiful as the trio of lakes that inspired it."," Mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Les Annees 25 Bis Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Les Annees 25 Bis is an exuberant throwback to what Andy Tauer refers to as the golden age of perfumery- 1920's Europe. During the so-called ""Anees Folles"", jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern woman, and Art Deco peaked- and every bit of that stylish, sexy, iconoclastic energy is captured in Les Annees 25 Bis, a fragrance in grand style, uncompromisingly vintage chic, and yet alluringly modern.Les Annees 25 Bis opens with a fresh citrus and fruit blast, combining the blinding brightness of bergamot and lemon with a mouthwatering peach accord and the intoxicating syrupiness of sweet orange oil. A glamorous heart finds lush natural rose absolute and ylang-ylang essential oil meeting a vibrant iris root, whose earthy depth steers the scent back into unisex territory. It also prepares the ground for a complex, luxurious base- benzoin, patchouli, sandalwood, ambergris, musks, and vanilla which melt together into a rich, exquisite, and long-lasting skin scent that boasts a vintage purr but a modern panache."," Bergamot, lemon, orange, peach, rose, iris, ylang, benzoin, vetiver, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31470.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odeur Du Theatre Du Chatelet Acte 1 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," Inspired by the history of the theatre mixed with the modernity of its new creative director Ruth Mackenzie. In other words, past and future have an olfactory dialogue on the velvet seats of the Parisian landmark in the tradition of Comme des GarÃ§ons anti-perfumes. The results are subtle and affecting- the energetic hum of black pepper and coffee like an orchestra tuning up, the smooth ambrette and orange blossom the buzz of the crowd, rich orris and sharp rose oxide the warm stage lights, and a deep and gently woodsy base the long lasting final applause. Make no mistake, Odeur Du Theatre Du Chatelet is among CDG's most subtle and avant garde scents thus far. But hidden within that subtlety is a fragrance of great personality and depth- a true tribute to pushing boundaries and creating art."," Ambrette, black pepper, rose oxide, coffee, orange blossom, orris, cashmeran, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zdravetz Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Woody, spicy, and herbaceous, the zdravetz herb which grows wild in Bulgaria has a reputation as a potent medicine- the word itself literally means ""health"" in Bulgarian. So we're not quite revealing a big secret to let you know that Zdravetz is an invigorating delight, a collection of juicy fruits, zesty citrus, lush florals, and fresh herbs that combine to inspire a delightful, indelible vitality. Grapefruit fizzes and pops, bright green galbanum hums with natural energy, and mouthwatering passionfruit combines with lush rose to seduce and enchant. Ultimately, the titular zdravetz weaves it all together in wild, woodsy, aromatic harmony. Wholly unique but wonderfully easy to wear, Zdravetz is a fresh-scent lover's dream."," Grapefruit, bergamot, galbanum, rose, passionfruit, cedar, leather, vanilla, zdravetz herb.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69315.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Corpse Reviver Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," In 2016, Bruno Fazzolari and Bogue's Antonio Gardoni released Cadavre Exquis, a playful and exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents through a sort of olfactory game of telephone. Featuring a striking dark chocolate note atop vintage-feeling aromatic florals, boozy fruit, and a potent dose of animalics, it was a monster of a scent- one that challenged- and rewarded- those off-kilter enough to get on its level. Now, with Corpse Reviver, Bruno Fazzolari has brought the spirit of Cadavre Exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together. And we must confess, it works perfectly- now, the rich, earthy indulgence of the dark chocolate springs more naturally from the juicy, boozy opening, while the animalics and spicy florals recede slightly in favor of the aromatics, allowing the composition to breathe and evolve. In the mood for a wholly unique, sophisticated gourmand with real artistic flair? Don't miss Corpse Reviver."," Blood orange, camphor, whiskey, rosemary, marigold, dried fruit, anise, cypress, dark chocolate, vanilla, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elysium Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is the original Elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. Forming part of Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long.  The original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the Parfum Cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. Joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. The fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the Cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. Towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. This Parfum Cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. If you'd like Aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder Bleu de Chanel, then step into the glorious Elysian Fields that is the Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne experience."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Creation-E Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," Roja's much loved Creation-E, or Enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of London's Saville Row tailors. But maybe – just maybe – you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though Roja would probably argue with us on that one). If you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart – Roja Dove has heard you. Creation-E Parfum Cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather.  The warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that ”˜rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. You still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but Creation-E Parfum Cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. Both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!"," bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de Grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Danger Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," A super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougÃ¨re with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, Danger Pour Homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via Roja Dove's  ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new Parfum Cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. This alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. Certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics – lavender, tarragon, and bergamot – and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Scandal Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," If the original Scandal pour Homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougÃ¨re on steroids (think Eau Sauvage to the nth degree), then the Parfum Cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. Through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately – the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. The original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the Parfum Cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.  But make no bones about it – the brighter ”˜cologne'-like freshness does not mean a drop in performance metrics. Operating at an eau de parfum concentration of 20%, Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne is still a rich, solidly classical fougÃ¨re that will keep you smelling like a Belgravia Square gentleman through to the end of the day. If you love the minty, herbal freshness of traditional barbershop scents and deplore the sweetness of modern masculines, then you'll love Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne's return to form."," lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, spearmint, lavender, basil, tarragon, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, cardamom, clove, nutmeg, moss, patchouli, vetiver, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, labdanum, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums," With its new iteration as a Parfum Cologne - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne – Roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his Vetiver par excellence. Indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of Vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. But Vetiver Parfum Cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. Its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. Let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. Choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. Or maybe don't choose at all -  get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! In other words, worry not. What we love the most about Roja's vetiver – its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness – has been transposed wholesale here into the Parfum Cologne."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Capitale Parfum,Xerjoff," Refined and robust, La Capitale is a testament to Moscow in all of its glorious contradictions- the grandeur and grime, the charm and the chaos, the history and hipness- a true international metropolis. Any fragrance to do justice to this fascinating city must, of course, be as larger than life as the city itself, and so La Capitale bursts forth from the skin, a fruity, spicy, luscious, indulgent fragrance full of joy, zest, and the indomitable Russian spirit. On first spray, La Capitale is an explosively fruity, mouthwateringly sweet affair- caramel-dipped strawberries drip with sugared indulgence, while a juicy peach adds quenching refreshment. The heart of the fragrance ushers in a sophisticated and luxurious floral leather, reinforced with resinous labdanum, lush rose, and a beguilingly spicy blend of saffron and ginger. It all rests atop a wonderfully Xerjoff base of benzoin, amber, and vanilla, smooth, rich, and delectable. Powerful, complex, and undeniably compelling, La Capitale is a fitting tribute to the glorious sophistication of Moscow."," Strawberry, caramel, peach, labdanum, leather, saffron, ginger, rose, amber, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SpeM PetraM Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," ""Spem Petram,  "" which translates to ""Stone of Hope,  "" is a deeply personal fragrance for Olivier Durbano,   one that finds his religious,   spiritual,   and artistic impulses overlapping to create a deeply resonant,   biblically-inspired (the capital M's are a nod to Mary Magdalene,   who in French religious lore lived out her life in the forests of Southern France) scent of dark wood,   spicy resin,   and incense. At its core is a unique ingredient oft-referenced in the good book- nard,   an aromatic central Asian plant related to valerian root with a distinctively earthy,   salty,   mineralic quality. It's the perfect bridge between the other ingredients- smoky olibanum,   fiery cinnamon and saffron,   sharp,   bright fir,   and rich woods,   everything combining to build to an ecstatic crescendo tempered with an unexpectedly lush rose note. Together,   it creates a powerful sense of exotic spirituality- potent,   warm,   and soothing,   but with an otherworldly characteristic that never becomes overly familiar."," Olibanum, cinnamon, bay leaf, saffron, fir balsam, cabreuva, rose, nard, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36917.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Maximus Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," What is real exoticism? This is something that you just couldn't try before. Today many people know what Oud is. But only a few know how rich and unusual can be the character of the wild Oud, fully revealed in a masterfully created blend. In Oud Maximus the concentration of Oud oils is so high that to preserve other notes, a special technique was created for mixing the Laotian, Indian and Thai Oud with four Rose oils from India, the Himalayas, Indonesia and France. The start of the fragrance is focused on the tantalizing animalistic character of the Oud from Laos, supported by Jasmine and Citruses. A voluminous accord of ambery Roses and Magnolia blossoms in the heart. The base consists of miscellaneous Oud oils, Civet and the Musk of Kabarga, which give the composition roundness and softness. This is how the precious fragrance maximally opening the heart of the wild Oud is born. No wonder, Oud Maximus is dedicated to the perfumer's son Maxim.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

Vetiver Nocturne Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," If you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. This note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. Only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. This is especially true when it comes to the precious Indian 25-year-old vetiver oil Ruh Khus, which forms the heart of VÃ©tiver Nocturne. In order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young Ruh Khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. The base of the composition consists of the oils of Indonesian Sandalwood and Oud Trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of White Champaca and Thai Jasmine. Floral notes revealed the beauty of Sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old Sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. Only the real Mysore Sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. It's hard to imagine a better framing for the Vetiver note than this.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

Love Mimosa Eau de Parfum,Amouage," What is the scent of bliss? An open-ended question, to be certain, but perhaps a bit less so once you take a sniff of Love Mimosa. For those who already love the distinctive soft scent of this unique flower, rest assured that Love Mimosa features a sublime expression of it, quenchingly refreshing but with almond and honey facets sure to have your mouth watering. But just as importantly, even those who've never counted mimosa among their favorites will find plenty to adore in this fragrance, which seamlessly layers a bouquet of precious florals along with the titular flower to create a multidimensional portrait of feminine tranquility and beauty. Creamy orris, powdery violet, and sweet ylang all mix with a gentle, juicy pear and an exotic array of soft musks to weave a spell of pure delight, simultaneously innocent and sophisticated all at once. Love Mimosa is more than just a name- it's a promise."," Violet leaves, cascalone, orris, mimosa, pear, paradisone, ylang ylang, ambrox, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41897.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Female Christ Eau de Parfum,19-69," On 29 May 1969, a naked woman carrying a cross walked through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange- an iconic piece of performance art carried out by Danish artists Lene Adler Petersen and BjÃ¸rn Norgaard that gripped the culture with its transgressive nature and exploration of religion, eroticism, and capitalism. However, as with so much of the genre-defying protest art of the '60s, only a photograph remains to commemorate the accomplishment. By introducing Female Christ the fragrance, a powerful, thoughtful, and deeply sensual blend of patchouli and resin, 19-69 preserves the essence of the art piece for the next generation to discover and learn. Female Christ is, first and foremost, a patchouli scent- rich, earthy, velvety, warm. Invigorating currents of spicy and herbaceous aromatics- eucalyptus, thyme, pimento- keep a bright liveliness in the foreground, while juicy rhubarb and berries add a sweet, fresh balance to the earthiness. As it dries, a sexy, provocative benzoin combines with dashes of vanilla and ambergris to transport the ever-present patchouli from the '60s milieu into something more transcendently contemporary, asserting the lasting significance of the piece that inspired the scent. 19-69 have already proven themselves masters of stylish, provocative patchouli scents- with Female Christ, they have raised the bar yet again."," Eucalyptus, patchouli, pimento, rhubarb, thyme, geranium, berries, vanilla, ambergris, benzoin, cinnamon, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Atomic Rose Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," If there's one thing Initio isn't known for, it's quiet fragrances- each release vibrates with an intense, sensual energy that's made the line an instant hit among stylish perfume lovers who want their signature scent to make a statement. Atomic Rose, their newest release, is another prime example of Initio's ability to find the harmonic balance between beauty and potency- a ravishingly sexy, invigoratingly unisex rose scent with liveliness and style to spare. Built around a ravishing duo of lush, top-quality Turkish and Bulgarian roses, Atomic Rose showcases every facet of its titular ingredient with carefully chosen supplemental notes- a juicy pop of bergamot, a spicy buzz of pink pepper, and a sumptuous blend of real florals (authentic Egyptian jasmine) and seductive floral derivatives (a potent dose of hedione) to seriously ramp up the power and sensuality. A long-lasting base of sweet, musky vanilla only deepens the effect, wrapping everything in a swoon-worthy haze. So no, Atomic Rose isn't the most naturalistic soliflore or softly-spoken feminine rose you've ever smelled- it's not meant to be. What it is, however, is rich, sexy, vivacious, and utterly unforgettable."," Bergamot, pink pepper, hedione, rose, jasmine, vanilla, ambrofix",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mizunara Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," A fragrance inspired by the distinct character of Japanese oak and beech trees spread over a rippling lake deep in the woods, Mizunara is an intriguingly complex combination of aquatic herbal notes and smoky woods that transport you to a hauntingly lovely and ancient forest tableau. At first spray, bright green galbanum fills the senses, like a fresh wind passing across the lake surface, carrying with it the scent of lily pads and pond algae, mixing with the invigorating wild herbs that grow on the ground below- rosemary and clary sage. A sharp lavender sparkles like the light reflecting onto the nearby beech leaves. As the distinctively Japanese wood notes emerge in strength- sharp and stout, with smoky tones- the second meaning of this fragrance emerges. Japanese wood, after all, makes up the barrels that give aged Japanese whiskey their distinctive flavor, and the wood here is cut with sweet, dry cognac oil to evoke the slightest hint of boozy malt beneath the patchouli and resins of Mizunara's base notes. The cumulative effect is one that should please liquor drinkers and nature enthusiasts alike- a fresh, bright, powerful woods scent, replete with uniquely Japanese character, deep and sophisticated enough for lovers of complex niche, but not without its easy-to-wear charm. In other words, a true fragrant journey the quality of which we've come to expect from the always exceptional Parfum Satori."," Galbanum, rosemary, clary sage, lavender, cognac oil, juniper, cypress, patchouli, blue chamomile, labdanum, tulu balsam, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/768005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fall Into Stars Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," Fall Into Stars is a meditation on the universe itself: dark, mysterious, yet leaving a trail of powerful illuminations. The scent contains a core of pure oud, which gives fallintostars a deep, primal quality, emphasized with amber and labdanum notes. It's complemented by ingredients like pink peppercorn and rosewood, which make the scent dreamlike and ethereal.The stardust and pollen effect come from natural and wild French daffodil; a golden amber effect comes from a Fairwild certified Peru Balsam and a Siam Benzoin resin, which cast light from the back of the scent; and an illuminating solar effect comes from fresh ginger, bergamot and saffron. That ensemble is nested in a combination of ouds, For Life-certified roses, and henna flower."," Daffodil, pink pepper, ginger, bergamot, saffron, rose, henna, oud, rosewood balsam, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre-Siam Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Chypre-Siam is a joyful middle finger to IFRA. Unrepentedly teeming with enough oakmoss to make an EU official faint, this is a fragrance that lays lie to the notion that they ”˜just don't make ”˜em like they used to anymore.' With Chypre-Siam, Manuel Cross proves for once and for all that it's not only possible make an authentic chypre in this day and age, but that it's possible to do it so well that it sounds like a battle cry. But if all Cross were to do is mix oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin together, it would be dull and derivative. Instead, Chypre-Siam has been designed as an irreverent ”˜South East Asian' take on the classic chypre, with a tart kaffir lime topnote replacing the traditional bergamot, and Thai holy basil to underline the minty bitterness of that oakmoss underpinning. Its raunchy, civet-inflected leather accord lends a lascivious purr that feels like labdanum ramped up beyond its normal range. And yet, despite the heavy-sounding notes, Chypre-Siam retains a fresh, translucent greenness all the way through – even the jasmine here smells more like violets in woodland than sultry white flowers. A warm, powdery trail lingers after the fireworks of the kaffir lime, oakmoss, and leather die down, the Siamese benzoin a sly nod to the South-East Asian inspiration for Chypre-Siam. Finally, a chypre that feels, smells, and actually is authentic."," oakmoss, kaffir lime, civet, jasmine, ylang, leather, spices, holy basil, sandalwood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tabac Vert Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Tabac Vert is a gentle tobacco breeze blowing in from the past, when tobacco-focused fragrance compositions were not sweetened with vanilla or tonka bean. With references to vintage Tabarome and Krizia Moods, Tabac Vert presents us with a gentlemanly vision of what tobacco can smell like when played with a subtle hand.The tobacco leaf in Tabac Vert is green and unsmoked - not yet 100% dry - and therefore has none of that ambery, dried fruit sweetness we are used to in modern tobacco scents. The main supporting character here is a dusty, spicy carnation that adds a slightly vintage feel. However, remarkably, nothing about this scent reads as dated. A peppery sandalwood and a fine dusting of subtle florals – rose and jasmine – give the tobacco-carnation heart a soft roundness that's comforting without being particularly sweet. Although the references here are all to great tobacco masculines of the past, we can't help but feel that a woman could totally rock this too."," tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mousse Illuminee Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," Mousse IlluminÃ©e is a delightful anachronism. It smells manly in the best possible way – soapy, bright, and almost cleansing in its bitterness, a cornucopia of camphoraceous green notes such as cypress, laurel, and artemisia stuffed into a cedar chest, aromatizing it from the inside out. FougÃ¨res used to smell like this, once upon a time, we remember. Now, shorn of any vanilla or sweetness, Mouse IlluminÃ©e returns the fougÃ¨re to its original form, stripping it back until we are left with a powerful and invigorating ”˜forest fern' accord that is unabashedly masculine.The deeply green atmosphere created by Mousse IlluminÃ©e revolves around a beautiful treemoss absolute from Robertet, but it is by no means the sole player. In particular, the minty laurel and camphoraceous aspects of the cypress and artemisia stand out, framed by an aquiline frankincense note that smells lightly smoky, but not burnt or severe. Best of all, there's no softening or fussiness towards the middle - a muscular musk simply carries the greenery on its broad shoulders to its natural conclusion."," treemoss, frankincense, green cypress, artemisia, laurel, cedar, white floral notes, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
40 Rogue Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," 40 Rogue is a recreation of the long-discontinued 40 Love by Jean Desprez, a fragrance that was apparently an interesting cross between an animalic, 1970s-style musk and a fougÃ¨re. Given the opportunity to smell a vial of this forgotten gem, Manuel Cross decided that it wassimply too good to lose to the mists of time, and so here we are!Fragrance fans not used to vintage perfume, or even vintage-style perfume, may want to adjust their television sets. 40 Rogue initially smells very vintage, with a burst of hairspray-ish aldehydes, wax-coated fruit, and a dusty carnation setting the scene in a pre-war diner in Paris, its spine straight and hair coiffed to an inch of its life. But this rich, formal air relaxes quickly, loosening its stays to let in gusts of aromatic, sunburnt herbs, lemon, and creamy, animalic musks that recall a fresher Jicky or even a jazzed-up Jovan's Musk (original 1970s formula). Fuzzy fruit, moss, and hay-like narcissus folded into a barbershoppy musk – what's not to like here?"," citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Derviche Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery," The brief Manuel Cross set himself for Derviche was simple – honor the famously soft green, powdery vanilla of vintage Emeraude by Coty but give it the power of one of those ambers coming out of the Middle-Eastern houses. In the end, Derviche smells very little like Emeraude but somehow features the same idea, which is to say a perfect balance struck between the tartness of citrus and the creamy sweetness of amber.At heart, Derviche is really all about hookah. The tobacco accord here is incredibly rich, with dried cherry facets that will make you think of revani, a Turkish semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup so sweet it's almost sharp. Unlike Ambre NarguilÃ© by Hermes, which Derviche resembles slightly, the ambery tobacco has a little animalic kick in its tail to keep things interesting. Civet and saffron act together to form a dry, slightly funky animal leather accord, while ambergris gives the dry-down a salty-sweet muskiness that's entrancing. If you love those big, insanely comforting old school balsamic ambers or tobaccos, then give this Derviche a whirl."," bergamot, labdanum, vanilla, jasmine, olibanum, sandalwood, musk, tobacco leaf, leather, saffron, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Radish x Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash," Radish and Vetiver- two roots with wildly different profiles. Vetiver, a staple of perfumery, grassy and sweet, earthy and spicy- a complex, multifaceted and often quite masculine aroma. Radish, on the other hand, not typically considered a desirably fragrant material, capable of the pungent sharpness of natural gas, but beneath the surface, possessed of a distinctive greenness and subtle citric qualities as well. An odd combination on paper, undeniably, but in the hands of Comme des Garcons, one that feels quintessentially CDG- the spice and earth of the vetiver made both more intense by the radish's petroleum-like tones, while also softened and brightened with the green elements. A scent that feels both uniquely natural and unnatural all at once- a sexy, fresh, and dare we say cutting-edge fragrance that anyone can pull off with panache. With Clashes like this, who needs to get along?"," Vetiver, radish, cypriol, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chlorophyll x Gardenia Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash," Gardenia is a very distinctive note,  known as a feminine and heady floral scent. To create a ""Clash, "" CDG worked on breaking down this overpowering essence with the freshness of chlorophyll. The results are as surprising as they are delightful- the fresh,  airy greenness of the chlorophyll adds space and a touch of bitter contrast to gardenia's rich and romantic lushness,  transposing the scent into pure unisex territory,  with a vivacious energy to offset the natural floral warmth. Invigorating,  fun,  and glowing with sunny disposition,  Chlorophyll x Gardenia is the kind of quirky yet everyday-appropriate modern scent that CDG has mastered."," Chlorophyll, gardenia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Celluloid x Galbanum Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash," The association of Celluloid and Galbanum is by essence contradictory. They originate from the opposite realms of technology and nature, plastic and resin converging. But, of course, this is the brand that's given us Garage, Tar, Odeur 53, and Concrete, so should it really be a surprise when we say that Celluloid x Galbanum just... works? Most of all the Clash scents, Celluloid x Galbanum finds the unexpected serendipity between the powerful, naturally spiky green of galbanum, and the deeply evocative artificial freshness of celluloid, reminiscent of everything from plastic school binders to a fresh-from-the-box pair of sneakers. You'll want everything in your life to smell like this- clean, green, and blissfully relaxed. Not to shabby for such a contradiction."," Celluloid, galbanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soleil Neige Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Crystalline. Cool. Escapist.The remote holiday of Tom Ford Soleil traverses from Courchevel to Megeve, inspiring Soleil Neige. The new Private Blend, alive with radiance and light-reflective ethereality, mimics the serene shimmer of sun on snow. The bright opening of bergamot and carrot seed mirrors the winter light, the cool reflection of the sun transforming everything in sight to a blanket of glacial white. The floral heart looks to the iridescent sky, blooming with pale petal shades of ivory and rose. The fresh green petals of jasmine grandiflorum, additive orange flower, and the transparent white floralcy of Karamalor Captive blends white blooms with the rich warmth of Turkish rose. The drydown melts onto skin with the wood and honey undertones of cistus labdanum, and skin-gripping musk as the resinous dimension of benzoin and creamy vanilla finish with sun-kissed warmth."," Bergamot, carrot seed, rose, jasmine, orange blossom, white flowers, rose, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Soleil Neige by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Wonder Of You Eau de Parfum,ALTAIA," We all love gigantic, luxuriously romantic scents- the kind that evoke the feeling of love at first sight. But Wonder Of You, the newest from Altaia, evokes a more subtle, but no less powerful kind of love- the joy of everyday love, a celebration of all the special moments and beautiful details that sustain a lifelong romance. It's a sparkling, soothing cocktail of citrus and florals that will have you basking in the glow of love from morning to night. From the first spritz, Wonder Of You is a pure and refreshing delight, opening with a mouthwatering blend of tart grapefruit and crisp blackcurrant that could put a smile on even the most weary face. A lovely heart of delicate freesia and juicy watermelon increases the lushness without an ounce of heaviness, and a smooth, clean musk drydown exudes gentle sensuality and understated sophistication. Is there a secret formula to a happy life with the one you love? We're obviously not qualified to answer that. But what Wonder Of You, in all of its understated beauty, suggests is that maybe it's as simple as taking pleasure in sharing the small and subtle joys of life. Who could argue with that?"," Blackcurrant, pink grapefruit, freesia, watermelon, ambrox, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Riviera Drive Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," The mythical scenic drive along the coastline of the French Riviera, so vividly captured in Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief with Grace Kelly and Cary Grant, is the inspiration for Riviera Drive, a thrillingly fresh new scent from Atelier des Ors. Just as the breathtaking views of the winding Cote d'Azure roads combine sun, sea, and flora as they weave through Menton on the way to St Tropez, so do does this fragrance combine vibrant citrus, electrifying aromatics, and sexy, soothing woody notes to evoke this iconic route. Riviera Drive opens with a vibrant spritz of bright lemon and the buzz of fresh herbs, giving us a grand panorama of the coastline from sky to land. As the woodsy notes emerge, we can picture our adventure taking us through the shade of the grand parasol pine trees, before a dash of intoxicating absinthe and a soothingly spiritual patchouli find us at our destination, exhausted but fulfilled, a sparkling cocktail in hand. Exhilarating and memorable, Riviera Drive is a summer delight."," Lemon, marjoram, rosemary, cedar leaf, absinthe, patchouli, cashmeran, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74411.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pomelo Riviera Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Pomelo Riviera whisks us away to the secluded garden of a villa overlooking the shimmering azure seas of the South of France. We smell an abundance of citrus trees, laden with fruits and fragrant flowers, caressed by a gentle ocean breeze. It's a vivid portrait of paradise- a moment in time we hope will never end. The unique beauty of Pomelo Riviera is the natural interplay between juicy tartness- zesty, radiant grapefruit and refreshing bergamot- and the silky smoothness of the deeply soothing floral bouquet of orange blossom, jasmine, and rose. The crystalline sparkle of the salt accord refracts the intensity of the sunlight, refining it into a radiantly seductive glow. Lively yet relaxing, Pomelo Riviera is a dynamic unisex citrus floral to celebrate the simple, memorable pleasures of a beautiful day well spent by the ocean."," Grapefruit, jasmine, bergamot, orange flower, salt accord, rose, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Riviera Lazuli Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," The warmest and richest of Atelier des Ors' Riviera trilogy, Riviera Lazuli is blissful blend of tart citrus and robust wood with a slow transition into a glowingly warm incense resin that evokes an unforgettable sunset over the azure waters of the Mediterranean. The outstanding citrus notes that have defined all three scents is still here, bright, juicy and robust, with a characteristically energetic spray of saltwater, but while a complement of aromatic woods is still present and vibrant, Riviera Lazuli moves in a duskier direction, with incense and and hints of dried immortelle providing warmth and a touch of caramel-inflected spice. Balsam adds an even warmer element, evoking sun-heated driftwood and the glow of sunset on skin. It's a perfect memory at the end of a beautiful day- a scent of wholesome indulgence and pure satisfaction you won't ever forget."," Lemon, cypress, bergamot, clary sage, cedar, gaiac, immortelle, fir balsam, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Yoyogi Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle," Yoyogi Park is one of the most beloved and celebrated green spaces in Tokyo. Nestled between the ultra-hip youth fashion mecca of Harajuku and the bustling social center of Shibuya, Yoyogi is a serene oasis, miles of soft grass, sparkling ponds, and the shade of gingko trees- a park for everyday Tokyo residents to congregate, relax, and play. Tyler BrûlÃ©, the founder of Monocle Magazine, found himself inspired during his morning jogs there, and so with the help of Comme des Garcons he set out to create a scent that captures the unique feeling of natural serenity that can occur in one of the world's busiest metropolises. And true to form, Yoyogi is a scent both serene and energetic, a perfect combination of soothing green notes resting on the negative space of the smoky, spicy cityscape beyond. Aromatic cypress lends a distinctly contemplative Japanese character, while the unmistakable crispness of freshly cut grass immediately puts us in BrûlÃ©'s jogging shoes on a dewey morning, the sun still low in the sky, the park nearly deserted and silent. As sweet, herbaceous chamomile and bitter, resinous wormwood emerge in the latter stages, we begin to experience the park- and Tokyo- at midday, an escape from the traffic and hustle but still fundamentally at the centre of the city- the kind of modern touch CDG is beloved for. Serene and natural, modern and exciting, all at one- that's the undeniably striking effect of a single spray of Yoyogi."," Cypress, mown grass, chamomile, wormwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chloe Sevigny Little Flower Eau de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," From her beginning days as a 90's streetwear fashion icon and ""the coolest girl in the world"" to an award-winning career in film and television, ChloÃ« Sevigny is truly one of a kind- a star who follows her own creativity and places passion over profit. Naturally, we knew her signature fragrance would have to be more than a by-the-numbers celebuscent, but Little Flower is so much more than we could have expected- a disarmingly fresh, exuberantly sexy rose that feels youthful and provocative all at once. Little Flower is built around rose, Sevigny's favorite note, and it's a beautiful specimen - a precious Ottoman rose absolute, romantic and bright, with a compellingly fleshy carnality. This raw appeal is tempered with sweet honeysuckle and fresh peony, and enhanced with the complexity of gently smoky black tea and the aromatic fruitiness of blackcurrant. A tart pomelo note adds a bright, youthful vivaciousness, which flows into a base of pillowy, clean musk. It's an arresting, versatile fragrance, to be worn by anyone with an artistic spirit and an independent soul. We'd expect nothing less."," Black tea, bleeding heart, blackcurrant bud, peony, palo santo, pomelo, honeysuckle, rose absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baie 19 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Truth is...Baie 19 should have been called Water 19. Not that it smells like nothing (though nothing smells like it), but it has this crisp, wet, drenched effect that water gives to the earth after the rain...And there's a word for that, by the way: petrichor. It's that magical feeling during heavy rain after a long dry spell, and it's one of the most beautiful olfactive phenomena in nature. There are many reasons for this, including the ozone in the air, the negative ions, but most importantly the release of oil secretions from certain plants, accumulated after a long dry period. This is what Baie 19 is about: the dry juniper berry, the patchouli, the green leaves... all soaked by a beautiful, luminous, magnetic rain after a long drought. And the joy that comes with it...Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

What We Think Refreshing, gentle, and deeply comforting, this is a petrichor lover's dream skin scent."," Juniper, patchouli, ambroxan, cade, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46875.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Across The Ocean Eau de Parfum,Gravel," The story of Gravel is one that connects two continents- Europe and North America- so it's only appropriate that their second scent is a tribute to the invisible ties between the two, and the luxurious overseas steamer ships of yesteryear that used to ferry people of all walks of life to and from the old country. Across The Ocean is a robust scent of smooth, deep woods, rich oud, and luxurious musk that exudes the gentlemanly sophistication of a bygone era. Citrus adds a light, bright touch to the opening notes, while tonka, musk, and vanilla soften and sweeten the richness of the woodsy base. Conceived by Joseph Knudsen as a men's scent, we find it easily wearable by anyone who enjoys potent but balanced woodsiness- the kind of scent that signifies good taste and adventurous spirit, all without shouting."," Bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terrible Teddy Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," ""Teddy lives for the thrill of the chase, ensnaring unsuspecting hearts with his scent.""You can be forgiven if the plotlines of the Penhaligon's Portraits series have become a bit too convoluted to follow- to be honest, we're not quite sure we know what's going on at this point. Luckily, all that matters (aside from those jaw-dropping caps) is the scent, and Terrible Teddy is a robust, masculine, and surprisingly nuanced leather and incense gem. While the imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks to Teddy's impressive lasting power, there's refinement and subtlety at play here- the opening bursts with piquant spice, the leather is luxurious and supple, the incense delicately smoky with a perfectly metered dollop of dark woodsiness in the drydown, leavened with the warm airiness of ambroxan. With a secret weapon like this, it's no wonder Terrible Teddy has managed to ensnare so many unsuspecting hearts."," Incense, leather, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Heartless Helen Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," ""Who needs romance when one wields power?"" That's the tagline for Heartless Helen, which Penhaligon's tells us is the olfactory story of a fearless conquistadora, fresh off her latest conquest. But while we don't for a moment doubt that this fragrance, imbued with  seductively lively tuberose, could give anyone the power to steal and break a few hearts, we wouldn't be so quick to paint Helen as a villain. To us, her signature scent is not only deeply sensual but also joyful and vibrant, a bouquet of narcotic white florals freshened with bright, juicy mandarin to capture the imagination. A gently creamy, warm woodsiness (we detect facets of sandalwood, gaiac, and cedar) adds sophistication and depth to the drydown, but the star of the show- the gorgeous, intoxicating tuberose- lasts from beginning to end. Is Heartless Helen truly as wicked as they say? Perhaps with a scent this brightly beautiful, it doesn't matter much- we're already in too deep."," Mandarin orange, tuberose, creamy woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Plumeria de Orris Extrait de Parfum,Areej Le Dore," This composition is dedicated to plumeria (known also as frangipani), the most gorgeous Asian flower. To find an extract that properly represents this flower is indeed a challenge. In Plumeria de Orris, we used nearly one kilogram of white frangipani extract that we believe captures the true nature of this exquisite blossom. We added a touch of genuine distilled plumeria oil, the rarest, most expensive floral essential oil we have ever encountered (at a price of over $200 per gram).Soft, powdery whispers of plumeria, full of narcotic, head-spinning, creamy floral notes, uplift the olfactory senses. Orris butter absolute further enhances its powdery splendor, making its floral soul even more expansive, deeper and longer lasting. A gentle touch of apricot, with its honeyed flesh and velvety suede skin, boosts the plumeria's fruity aspect. It adds juicy sweetness and an almost gourmand nuance to the top notes.Creamy floral notes slowly sink into buttery sandalwood. Wild aroma of civet adds a dash of animalic depth to the arrangement. Clouds of vanilla emerge from hiding behind the woods and deliver delicious olfactory joy.Dense and incensey myrrh embraces oriental notes. Rich and resinous, this time-honored ingredient blends perfectly with dark and sooty vetiver. Virginian cedarwood provides a smoky, woody texture that perfectly completes this lush, luxurious composition and creates a well-balanced earthy backbone.Plumeria, the floral soul of Asia, has been immersed in an apricot cocktail and magnified by oriental, incensey, animalic woods. Plumeria de Orris is a mesmerizing journey to Asia, a land that is both astonishingly wild and breathtakingly beautiful."," plumeria absolute, natural apricot accord and orris root absolute, sandalwood, vanilla and synthetic civet, myrrh, vetiver and cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/784017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love Kills Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," While the concept of a soliflore might suggest simpler, more linear scents, one sniff of Love Kills should quickly disavow you of that notion. Instead, Caroline Dumur has created a rose soliflore with luscious yet edgy depth, one that masterfully plays off of the well known phrase it takes its name from to present both the romantic and dangerous sides of the grand dame of perfume florals.On the ""Love"" side of things, the fragrance opens with joyful brightness, using a mouthwateringly juicy lychee note to introduce a sparkling, ambrette-tinted rose oxide. As it blossoms into a full-bodied, romantic Turkish rose absolute, we see the darker, more sensual, ""Killer"" side of the equation- sultrier floral tones, animalic musk, and a woodsy patchouli distillation with a decidedly...thorny quality. It's a portrait of love in full- the joy, the hope, the intensity, and even the heartbreak, all contained within the multifaceted beauty of a rose."," Lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oriental Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," At nightfall, the Wahiba Sands of Oman become a dreamscape of reddish dunes, casting a unique glow onto the sky above. The heavenly canopy lights up the path to Wadi Shab, a lush paradise, bursting forth from beyond the sand, etching itself permanently into the imagination.A majestic and sophisticated scent, Oriental Leather is a rich tapestry of piquant spice, smooth resins, and a dusty floral leather note that combines with rich, dry patchouli to produce visions of a glowing desert night where the stars and the sand connect so seamlessly that it's impossible to tell where one ends and the next begins. At turns shimmeringly piquant and alluringly rich, it seems to dance on the skin, hypnotizing us with its exotic and otherworldly call. Like the Omani desert night sky, Oriental Leather is a magical, unforgettable experience."," Coriander, pimento, lavender, leather, anise, geranium, cinnamon, benzoin, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69126.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rolling in Love Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Rolling in Love is a musc de peau, capturing the sensation of feeling so high on love that it seems to almost“get under the skin.” Working with perfumer Pascal Gaurin, Kilian Hennessy took an entirely new direction. Rolling in Love is more direct and less faceted than his previous fragrances””almost“monochromatic” in its focused representation of a single emotion. Rolling in Love is a“white” scent, layering different textures along the scent's trail with notes of ambrette seeds, almond milk, iris, and musk. What We Think It may be conceived as a ""skin musk""  but there's plenty going on in this undeniably sexy blend of narcotic florals, creamy almond, and smooth, sensual musks. You won't be able to stop sniffing yourself- or anyone wearing it."," Almond milk, iris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Khandjar Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," The souq of Muttrah, found in the heart of Muscat, is the perfect place to search for a legendary Khandjar dagger- the identity, pride and heritage of Oman that carries the virtues of luck and protection from evil. They say wearing a Khandjar is like carrying a piece of the Omani soul, and Ambre Khandjar is a tribute to the power of tradition. It is a powerful oriental amber, sweet and rich with syrupy plum and warm resin. Modern metallic facets and a lingering of leather and vanilla make it timeless, warm and addictive. A scent of skin tanned by the sun and the cold of metal, Ambre Khandjar is a timeless treasure worthy of its namesake."," Mandarin, Black Plum, Cistus Labdanum Aboslute, Vanilla Pod O2, Orris Absolute, Ylang Ylang, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Benzoin Resinoid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jardins de Misfah Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," In the village of Misfah Al Abreyeen, a cornucopia of pomegranates, peaches, figs, and apricots grow abundantly in the midst of the mountain aridity, with marvelous palm trees as far as the eye can see, their branches heavy with the weight of dates. It is the bounty of legend come to life, an ingeniously engineered garden paradise created by warriors who set down their weapons to grow instead of destroy.Jardins de Misfah is a harmony of ripeness- a whisper of fresh flower petals fused with an accord of creamy dates, syrupy honey and sweet rosewater. A delicate yet deliberate dusting of exotic spices deepens the feminine sensuality, while a gently green and powdered almond provides an unconventionally smooth gourmand base. Fresh, rich, and mouthwatering all at once, Jardins de Misfah is a gorgeously wearable portrait of abundance."," Cardamom, Nutmeg, Date Accord, Rose Absolute, Rose Essence, Saffron, Almond",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suma Oriental Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Suma Oriental refers to the brilliant collection of writings by TomÃ© Pires, a Portugese apothecary who became ambassador to China in the 16th century. An intensely detailed description of an insular southeast Asia, Suma Oriental revealed for the first time that sandalwood originated in the Sumba, or modern day Indonesia. So it's only fitting that Suma Oriental is a portrait of sandalwood in all of its rich dimensionality, a mesmerizing scent that pairs creamy, warm sandalwood with boozy rum, velvety patchouli, and powdery tonka to create a lushly seductive fragrance that hums with mystery and majesty. A robust cocoa note adds sweet, earthy complexity, while a gaiac-forward base of smooth woods supplement the sandalwood's mouthwatering depth. Like Pires' seminal work, Suma Oriental invites us to discover an exotic and captivating unknown world- don't miss your opportunity."," Cypriol, Rum, Cocoa, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Tonka Bean, Cashmere Wood, Gaiac Wood, Clear Wood, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mr. Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," This is a story about a man who you may have encountered somewhere near Java. People say he is tall, with skin that has been tanned by the sun and tattooed by the passage of time. His blue gaze plunges into the viewfinder of his Leica- but who is he? An olfactory portrait of a legendary Javan photographer and gadfly, Mr. Vetiver turns out to be a fragrance both exotic and sporty, relaxed and refined- a perfect demonstration of all that vetiver can do. Opening with a buzz of fresh citrus and spice, Mr. Vetiver instantly demonstrates a comfort with the complexity of its titular ingredient, which is featured in full- earthy, grassy, sweet, clean, woodsy, and spicy, all in perfect harmony. Rich, mouthwatering cardamom sidles up smoothly beside aromatic basil and tarragon, and a unique piri-piri pepper adds a fiery touch of distinction. The results are as versatile and easy to wear as they are undeniably compelling. An elegant fragrance revealing the freshness of Vetiver in a spicy and delicate accord, Mr. Vetiver is a man-about-town you're going to want to get acquainted with."," Cardamom, Grapefruit, Lime, Basil, Tarragon, Geranium, Vetiver.

Fleur des Fleurs Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali, island of flowers. The ylang-ylang, sweet, rich, and luscious, is so highly prized for its complex fragrance and incomparable benefits for the mind and body that it means 'Flower of Flowers' in the Malay language. And jasmine is the queen of the night, patiently waiting for sunset so she can release her powerful, warm perfume into the air. Fleur des Fleurs is an ode to ylang-ylang and jasmine, an intense white floral accord with deep, romantic lushness. Freshness is provided with the crisp citric tang of grapefruit and the mouthwatering savor of saffron, while a deep, woodsy base of sandalwood and amber nourishes the soul. A tropical floral of depth and character, Fleur des Fleurs more than earns its superlative."," Bergamot, Saffron, Grapefruit, Jasmin, Ylang-Ylang, Tubereuse, Glycine, Benzoin Tears, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber, Oud Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Murmure des Dieux Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali the Spiritual, the island that wakes up slowly each day to the rhythm of offerings. This is a time when women gather freshly cut flowers to accompany their religious rituals. Bali's iconic flower is the 'Jepun', or frangipani. It has a particular prestige for the Indonesian people and is part of their mystique; its vivid colors decorate most temples. Both a symbol of the god Shiva and a way to channel prayers, the frangipani flower evokes the island's inner voice. Murmure des Dieux is the very expression of lightness of the soul. An airy perfume taking the form of a reassuring whisper. An olfactory phrase like a mantra on the skin. This delicate accord intertwines the slightly almond and refined sweetness of the Frangipani flower, the unctuousness of vanilla and the reassuring roundness of musks. Mumure des Dieux is an exotic, singular and extremely carnal perfume."," Frangipani, Almond, Vanilla, Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bohemian Soul Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," In 1966 the documentary 'Endless Summer' was released, chronicling two American surfers' quest for the perfect wave. From the end of their surfboards, we experience the desire to push time zones further away so the summer never ends. This quest continues, with the entire planet becoming a refuge of immense beaches punctuated with hiding places where free spirits love to converge.Bohemian Soul is a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing fragrance that reflects this journey with elegance and modernity: the immediate freshness of artemisia, like a gentle wind rising up over the ocean, giving way to rooty iris and clean guaiac wood before the flourish of creamy sandalwood and the delicacy of soft, seductive musk entwine. It's a primally comforting mix, the kind of fresh musky scent perfect for women and men alike who crave clean and sporty in equal measures- a freshness that's as far from boring as the vagabonds and surfer kings who inspired it in the first place."," Artemisia absinthium, Olibanum, Guaiac Wood, Iris, Myrrh, Musc, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Memory Motel Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," When Andy Warhol moved to Montauk, he became an anchor point, a lighthouse for an entire generation of artists. He rented his mansion for a summer to the Rolling Stones, who were rehearsing for their tour and pre-recording what would be one of their greatest albums, ”˜Black and Blue', which included the melancholy ballad ”˜Memory Motel'.This eponymous perfume is a burning tribute to those restless, turbulent times. An androgynous perfume with notes of tobacco wrapped in patchouli leaves, pierced with a touch of vanilla. Smoky, spicy, mossy, and floral, with just the slightest hint of sweetness, it feels like it could be the smell of an iconically kitschy motel hallway, faded carpet and cigarette smoke, primally comforting, with seduction, adventure, relaxation, and beautiful mundanity hidden behind each subsequent door."," Bergamot, Iris, Incense, Carnation, Mosses, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tobacco, Leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kalan Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," The true majesty of French formal gardens comes in the blend of imposing strength and gentle beauty only achievable with great expense and effort--a perfect synthesis of elegance and majesty. In Kalan, Parfums de Marly captures that beautiful balance through the juxtaposition of two quintessentially French heart notes--lush, lovely orange blossom, and bright, masculine lavender, for a fragrance that evokes the breathtaking splendor of the gardens at Versailles itself.Intense and subtle all at once, Kalan surprises with a sparkling opening, blending black pepper and spices with juicy, invigorating notes of blood orange. The fragrance's essence is embodied in the aforementioned heart of orange blossom and lavender, soft and sharp, intertwining to wondrous effect. And in a deep, unforgettable base, facets of white sandalwood unfold and drape into notes of moss and precious wood--an exploration that takes us from the gardens to the forest and back again. Bright, smooth, utterly captivating, Kalan immediately places itself in the firmament of Parfum de Marly's absolute best."," Blood Orange, Black Pepper, Lavender, Solar notes, Orange Blossom Absolute, Moss, Precious Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/700030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aventus Cologne Eau de Parfum,Creed," How does one go about reinventing a classic? If you're the house of Creed, you take everything that people loved about Aventus and Aventus For Her and bring it all together in a universal scent that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Meet Aventus Cologne, a fresher, more modern complement to two iconic scents that provides an olfactive experience all its own. The woody fresh Aventus Cologne opens with bright giner, mandarin, and pink pepper, giving an invigorating unisex start that Aventus devotees should find both recognizable and novel. An earthier, deeper heart reveals notes of rich patchouli, creamy Indian sandalwood, and spicy, lightly citric vetiver. And while robust, elegantly masculine birch still sings in the long-lasting base, it's now refined with resinous styrax, and a smoothly unisex combination of musk and tonka bean which exudes graceful power. Aventus and Aventus For Her fanatics have always known there was something special at the core of their scents- now, it's all in one completely irresistible package--a new modern classic."," Ginger, mandarin, baie rose, patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver, styrax, birch, musk, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49376.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Harem Soiree Parfum,Arte Profumi," A boozy rose dipped in honey and plunged into the salty rawness of ambergris, Harem Soiree is a stunning attar-like fragrance that takes no prisoners in the floral oriental genre. The ambergris lends a fiercely saline, windswept edge to the ambery underpinnings of the fragrance, joining with a resinous, licorice-like myrrh to render a picture of an unsweet, unpolished chunk of amber resin that has just washed up on a beach somewhere along the Baltic coast. The textural contrasts in Harem Soiree are incredibly satisfying, especially in the juxtaposition of the syrupy, honeyed rose against the rough-edged, salt-and-pepper dryness of the ambergris and myrrh notes. Rich in a mouthwateringly sweet-and-savory way that keeps you interested all day long, Harem Soiree has the additional advantage of being hugely radiant and sillage-aceous - outwitting humidity, showers, or whatever else you can throw at it. To wear Harem Soiree is to be bathed in your own personal halo of roses, precious resins, and salty ambergris, saturating the air around you in a heavy rose-gold hue. Divine."," ambergris, rose, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Rouge,Arte Profumi," Velvet Rouge is not for a perfume for wallflowers. Immediately enveloping and rich, it lustfully embraces the bold statement that only coffee beans, licorice, and cacao pods can make when exposed to high heat – a delightfully aromatic, burnt aroma that fans of both Borneo 1838 by Serge Lutens and Coze by Parfumerie Generale will adore. Despite its cocoa-dusted opening, however, Velvet Rouge steers well away from the gourmand elements of its dark materials, choosing instead to chase the cocoa down with a hit of bright, spicy chili pepper and a dusting of nutmeg. With a rooty, slightly dirty-grungy vetiver and what smells to us like a ton of sooty frankincense bringing up the rear instead of the usual vanilla or amber, Velvet Noir retains its slightly austere, mysterious character throughout. It finishes out on an unusual accent of smoked-out licorice. A scent full of shadows and secrets, Velvet Rouge is perfect for those of few words and un-guessed-at depths."," cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Sacre Parfum,Arte Profumi," Bois Sacre, or sacred wood, is an artistic rendering of the yin and yang character of two of the most precious woods in the world, namely Indian oud and sandalwood. Cleverly playing the animalic, leathery sourness of Indian oud off against the buttery, aromatic dryness of Indian sandalwood, the result is a scent that is exuberantly rich and full-flavored but not in the slightest bit heavy. The medley of woods here seems to shimmer in the air like the red dust over a North African desert. If the woods are remarkably airy, the doughy, treacly resinousness of labdanum moves quickly into place underneath to ground them. Growing ever drier and leatherier over time, we love how the labdanum lends an earthy, resinous heft that acts as a center of balance for the scent without ever drowning the woods in the buttery sweetness of vanilla. There's even a dusty ”˜hot paper' note in the drydown that makes us think of benzoin, even though none is listed. Dry but rich, this is the perfect woody oriental for cold weather."," agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Samharam Parfum,Arte Profumi," Samharam is a rich incense scent that traces a straight line to the ancient aromas of myrrh and benzoin that would have accompanied the caravan traders that moved from across the deserts from the spice and resin markets of Somalia and Oman to Venice and beyond. Opening with a triumphantly coca cola-ish myrrh with smoky licorice overtones, Samharam rolls on like a stone, picking up the deeply sooty nuances of Somali frankincense and elemi, as well as the sweeter ”˜hot brown paper' powderiness of benzoin. Samharam smells both sacred and profane, the ethereal ”˜High Church' lift of the incense raising our thoughts up to the heavens, while all the time enticing our more gustatory senses with a pleasing bite of black pepper and a slightly salty amber. Although not foody in the slightest, there's something piquant in this incense accord that pricks the saliva glands and makes our bellies growl. Incredibly full-figured and rich, as all Arte Profumi fragrances are, Samharam is the old world Italian artisanal response to the thin and bony incense scents of modern lore."," myrrh, incense, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sucre Noir Parfum,Arte Profumi," Sucre Noir deserves the same Holy Grail status granted by vanilla lovers to Tihota by Indult or Vaniglia by Mazzolari. One of the most luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled, it is the olfactory equivalent of being wrapped up in the purest, ”˜whitest' cashmere blanket that costs  more than most of us earn in a month. There's a luxury in its simplicity, because there's nowhere for any mistakes to hide. Recalling nothing more than the nostalgic goodness of white sugar infused with the sultry warmth of a vanilla bean or two, and perhaps a breath of cocoa-dusted vanilla orchid, it is the sort of  vanilla we loved first while learning about taste and smell – that pure ”˜white' sort of sweetness as of yet unsullied by smoke, musk, or resin. The cane sugar is the perfect final touch, its slightly burnt, brown sugar aroma adding an interesting caramelization that creates depth but not shade. Vanilla lovers – we are putting you on notice!"," orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oeilleres Parfum Extrait,Roberto Greco,"“I want to echo the flowers I photograph without referring to any one in particular. Therefore, along with Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, we decided to exclude rose, jasmine and all the overly tangible flowers. We managed to express the general idea of floralcy through the dried flower, pollen and honey facets of chamomile and broom. To connect the scent with the figures I photograph, I also wanted to convey the feel of flesh. In order to achieve this, we brought out the animal aspects of vegetal notes, as well as various spices and resins.  Though it wasn't an end in itself, the fragrance is bursting with natural ingredients – sometimes in very high doses, all the better to express the organic duality of my images. Between the delicacy of a fading petal and the radicality of a fold of skin.” ”” Roberto GrecoÅ’illÃ¨res - L'Objet parfumant is the anti-flower fragrance, a truly rare, beautiful creation. Produced in limited edition of 500 pieces worldwide."," Eucalyptus, broom, chamomile, lavender, cumin, incense, hay, musk, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/835000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Slow Dance Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," The slow dance: a rite of passage for girls and boys before they metamorphose into women and men. A feeling of exhilaration tempered, or perhaps heightened, by awkwardness. A heady collision of innocence and experience, knowing and not knowing, felt universally across countries, cultures, and time. Slow Dance: a scent that evokes these collective memories and experiences in a unisex oriental amber, bitter and sweet, intoxicating and youthful. A top note of sweet myrrh provides an immediate honeyed, smoky sensuality against a heart of creamy, ambery labdanum and sparkling fresh geranium. All is swathed in a magical veil of violet, while a base of vanilla and patchouli anchor the amber notes, a contrast between sweet and earthy, mouthwatering and mysterious, that brings our minds back to school gymnasiums and stolen kisses. Between childhood and adulthood, our deepest and most profound memories are formed. Spray on Slow Dance, and find yourself transported back to that unforgettable place."," Opoponax, geranium, labdanum, violet, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Air Des Alpes Suisses Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Andy Tauer has a singular gift for olfactory mise en scene: fragrances so majestically evocative that you feel transported not only to a location, but into an experience: strolling through a Rahat marketplace at sunset (L'Air du Desert Marocain), ripping down Route 66 in a panhead Harley-Davidson (Lonesome Rider), or looking up at the Southwest sky next to a crackling fire (Lonestar Memories). For his newest experience, Andy invites us to the country where he lives and creates amongst the pristine natural beauty of the Swiss Alps.L'Air Des Alpes Suisses opens bright, fresh, and invigorating, with notes of bitter, lively alpine herbs and cool glacier air. As if on our own Swiss adventure, our journey then leads us into the fresh, green heart, the air rich with blooming alpine lilies and pine needles drying on the forest floor. And finally, we smell the warm woods of the timber trees, sweetened with the amber tones of earth drying in the midday sun. It's about as different from most of his previous offerings as can be, but for one simple truth- it's deeply, beautifully evocative in the way that only Tauer can be. Discover L'Air Des Alpes Suisses today, and lose yourself in the bright, fresh, natural beauty of Switzerland."," Amber gris, tonka, fir, birch, dried needles, lily, orchid, wild thyme, basil, rosewood, nutmeg, mountain lavender, lemon balm",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31469.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

La Couche du Diable Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," La Couche du Diable (we'll choose to forego some of the raunchier translations and simply call it ""The Devil's Bed"") was bound to cause a fuss- after all, throughout his many releases, Serge Lutens has never before featured oud in a fragrance. But with that in mind, don't expect anything resembling a typical oud scent. Oh, there's an unmistakably high-quality oud in here- darkly woodsy, warm, and sweetly balsamic- but its more challengingly animalic tones are, if not subverted, at least channeled into resinous cistus and syrupy fruit-and-rose combination that incite a sense of deep, seductive comfort. Serge Lutens' own copy describes La Couche du Diable as ""a diabolical and sumptuous veil of indulgence and remorse for a first transgression."" We'd agree, up to a certain point- but if we're being honest, when it comes to this stunning fragrance- remorse doesn't even cross our mind."," Oud accord, cistus jam, fruity complex, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36169.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baikal Leather Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," In the seemingly endless expanse of the Siberian birch forests, the majesty and power of nature can leave one with a humbling and awe-inspiring new perspective on where they fit into the hierarchy of the natural world. This breathtaking natural beauty is the inspiration for Patricia and Axel de Nicolai's newest leather scent, a robust yet velvet-soft offering that eschews the garishness of brutal, flashy leathers for the smoothness of freshly-tanned suede, placed expertly in the midst of the crisp and invigorating scents of a wild Siberian birch forest. The leather aspect of this EDP is essentially created by blending two dry, woody notes: essence of gaiac wood and essence of smoked pine. This powerful duet is revealed by a fiery start of spicy citrus with yuzu, pepper and saffron, while the aromatic touch of spearmint completes the top note. The floral heart of rose and violet envelops the leather, softened by an iris butter, tonka beans and white musk background. Robust yet refined, Baikal Leather is a leather of unusual distinction."," Yuzu, pepper, saffron, leather, birch, violet, rose, iris butter, gaiac, sandalwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313060.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Corpi Caldi Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte," Who says grown-up fun needs to be so, well, grown up? Corpi Caldi is inspired by evenings under the stars with dear friends, sipping sweet, fizzy cocktails. It's dancing the night away to an irresistible jazz orchestra, laughing and spinning and embracing the joy life still has to offer. And with a bright yet sophisticated, fresh and mouthwatering combination of floral and gourmand notes, Corpi Caldi truly embodies the idea of carefree, yet distinctively grown-up revelry. It's a distinction that shines through from the very first spray, as a sunny and fresh combination of plum and grapefruit is given an aromatic complexity with gardenia leaf and a striking pop of mint. The floral bouquet at the heart is no less unique, with the lushness of orange blossom and rose enhanced with a cool, earthy iris and a sweet twist of ylang. And in the sumptuous base, creamy vanilla is kissed with an ambergris glow and the lightly almond-inflected tones of heliotrope. All together, it creates a rare accomplishment- a lush, fruity gourmand that offers multiple surprises, but no unpleasant shocks. In other words, it's the sort of adult fragrance that proves that growing up can just make life better and better."," Gardenia leaf, plum, grapefruit, mint, ylang ylang, orange blossom, rose, iris, patchouli, vanilla, oakmoss, white musks, ambergris, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elae Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Elae wears its femininity like a luminous offering: it unfolds like a bouquet of white petals with woody notes, filled with warmth and tenderness. Of proud descent, Elae is embedded, through her Latin name, with the protective aura of Diana, goddess of the hunt. A clear evocation of faraway lands that need to be conquered, Elae is fragrant with flowers yet bears a narcotic sensuality. Elae unfolds like a transparent floral perfume with light notes that float."," African neroli, Ylang-Ylang, Egyptian jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/559082.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Squid Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges. Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. A massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer, this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.Zoologist Squid sings a song of a dark, tumultuous sea of tangy brine, the stormy air electrified with pink pepper and the elemental glow of salicylate. Crisp, smoky incense evokes an ominous twilight, while a uniquely sweet, cloudy ink accord should leave no doubt why this unforgettable scent earned its name. Finally, all is united with the moody, compellingly oceanic aroma of ambergris. Like the endless depths that inspired it, this elegant scent ripples with the mysteries of the sea."," Pink Pepper, Solar Salicylate, Incense, Black Ink Accord, Salty Accord, Opoponax, Ambergris, Benzoin, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/760025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sir Winston Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," To pay tribute to a man of globe-spanning accomplishment, a fragrance of ordinary ingredients and vision just wouldn't do. Sir Winston, we're pleased to report, is no ordinary fragrance. Rather, it is a dynamic blend of some of the world's most exquisite ingredients, including real ambergris, rich tobacco, and an unparalleled specimen of Indonesian Bouya oud oil. The effect is a fragrance that celebrates the rugged, uncategorizable, self-determined man- a scent of strength and adventure. Sir Winston is unique right from the start, as a combination of smooth green tea and a possibly unlisted boozy note combine to deliver the rich, sweet, bracing kick of a tumbler of exquisite brandy. Warm, sun-kissed ambergris softens the rougher edges of a raw tobacco absolute, imposing and regal, while precious Indonesian oud meets vanilla for a mouthwatering yet sensual animalism. Not every man (or woman) can pull off Sir Winston, but that's on purpose- those who can are surely already part of a rare and impressive cohort."," Green Tea, Tuberose, Ambergris, Tobacco Absolute, Vanilla, Indonesian Bouya (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Symphonie de Neroli Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," While every Bortnikoff fragrance is surely a symphony- a masterful blending of the best ingredients in the world to produce something more than the sum of its parts- you might be initially surprised that Symphonie de Neroli is the one that earned the symphonie right in the title. After all, this is arguably Bortnikoff's most focused, uncomplicated-feeling scent so far, a bright, cheerful, naturalistic celebration of perfume's most beloved white floral. But one glance at the impressive notes list, and it's plain to see that this seemingly simple soliflore is as complex a creation as any- with each exquisite ingredient carefully selected to enhance the beauty of neroli in full. Bright, dynamic citrus gives intense freshness, while rich jasmine sambac supplements neroli's lush, romantic tones. Exceptional Javan and Indian vetiver alongside Virginian cedarwood coax out the woodsy and spicy elements, joining a balsam-infused oud to create a warm, glowing base that feels entirely in the spirit of neroli. Fresh, lush, spicy, romantic, rich, warm? Finally, a neroli scent that truly lets you have it all."," Bergamot, Lemon, Lime, Clementine, Neroli, Jasmine Sambac, Vetiver from Java, Vetiver from India (Ruh Khas), Ambergis, Oakmoss, Virginian Cedar, Oud from Trat, Peru Balsam, Tolu Balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zemfira Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Zemfira is the positively delightful answer to a simple question: what if a rose-oud scent didn't take itself quite so seriously? This, of course, isn't to say that any aspect of Zemfira is less than the utmost quality- from pure Vietnamese oud oil to Europe's finest Rose de Mai to authentic Atlas cedarwood, Zemfira is undoubtedly fit for royalty. But this is a brighter, fresher, more youthful rose-oud than you've experienced before- less Queen, more Princess- with juicy bergamot, zesty pink pepper, and a blend of the aforementioned Rose de Mai with an especially fresh, young tea rose that positively sings with young energy. The oud, too, is vibrant- green, bright, and not at all barnyard funky, and blended perfectly with creamy sandalwood and stout, fresh cedar to take an often exotic and heavy pairing and reinvent it as romantic and energetic. Rose-oud lovers looking for something you've never smelled before? Make haste for Zemfira- but leave your stuffy preconceptions at the door."," Bergamot, Pink Pepper, Rose de Mai, Hybrid Tea Rose, Atlas Cedar, Bengalian Sandalwood, Vietnamese Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Los Angeles Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," A perfect day in Los Angeles might start early, as a sparkling ray of morning sunlight illuminates an abundance of flowering native florae. That same day might end late, but not too late, as the last notes of your favorite band echo off the starlit hills surrounding the Hollywood Bowl. Sure, L.A. may not have much of a claim to being The City That Never Sleeps, but with beginnings and endings as beautiful as ours, who says that's a bad thing?That perfect morning spent in your blooming garden? That's the airy, aromatic opening of Los Angeles, as vivid notes of eucalyptus and clary sage, along with a spritz of oceanside saltiness, stimulate a sense of calm, relaxed, natural energy- the very spirit of L.A. itself. A rich and spicy floral heart- tuberose and narcissus- celebrates the vibrant and romantic Mexican culture diffused through the heart of the city. And finally, a smoky, woodsy, shimmering base of cade and gaiac represents the boundless and far-flung nightlife, which often combines L.A.'s reputation for creativity and artistic innovation with the bounty of natural beauty and outdoor space at our fingertips. Sure, we might head home before the sun comes up- but as Gallivant's perfect tribute to our hometown proves, it's because tomorrow promises to be just as full of adventure as today."," Eucalyptus, clary sage, mandarin, pineapple, tuberose, narcissus, cade, gaiac, nagarmotha, musk, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Keep Glazed Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Patisserie and perfume- two art forms dedicated to sensory pleasure and indulgence, where skilled execution and artistic vision are equally important if one is to create a masterpiece. Keep Glazed, THoO's collaboration with Canadian Patisserie's Ksenia Penkina, is indeed a perfect fusion of talent and technique, as delectable flavours of tropical fruit and rich pastry are blended with a deft and delicate touch, creating a mouthwatering yet complex gourmand scent of rarified sophistication. Keep Glazed opens with a sumptuous collection of fruit-based notes that reveal their depth in the details- the tart, icy snap of frozen lemon, the aromatic freshness of strawberry leaf, and the juicy tropical energy of wild mango. Chantilly cream stands out beyond an average vanilla note, sweet yet airy, and never cloying as lesser vanillas can be, joining with flakes of coconut and a gently fiery ginger crumble to bring a true dimensionality to this perfectly balanced confection. And even hours later, the softly musky, woodsy base keeps everything humming- sexy, scrumptious, but never showing off. There are many gourmands out there, but few with the careful detail and fruit-forward dynamism of Keep Glazed- and we couldn't be happier."," Frozen lemon, mango, strawberry leaf, chantilly cream, grated coconut, ginger crumble, fruity musk, precious woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76426.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ristretto Intense Cafe Extrait de Parfum,Montale," For those who appreciate quality over quantity, the ristretto is a mark of culinary character- a short shot of espresso that delivers intense yet smooth flavor in a single sip. With Ristretto Intense Cafe, Montale refines their already beloved combination of robust coffee, lush rose, and warm vanilla with a richer, more concentrated version that pairs multiple facets of rose and coffee alongside a captivating sweet toffee note to increase both teh sophistication and the pure indulgence. Fans of the original will recognize the iconic coffee opening, but as is befitting the Ristretto version, the note is both smoother and darker, combining with a fresh, vegetal rose to produce an unexpectedly dry and refreshing top note. As the coffee softens, the lusher aspects of rose strike a sensuously familiar tone, while a vanillic white musk emerges, slightly sweetening the brew with just a hint of cream and sugar. For lovers of Intense Cafe looking for the next level as well as anyone seeking superb, sophisticated gourmand scents, Ristretto Intense Cafe is a demi-tasse of pure magic."," Italian black coffee, rose water, rosebud, roasted coffee beans, dry wood, vanilla, white musk, sweet toffee, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Instant Crush Eau de Parfum,Mancera," We all know the feeling: with a single glance your jaw drops, your knees buckle, and every last thought in your head is replaced with pure infatuation. It's this magic that Mancera has on its hands with Instant Crush, an irresistible combination of rose, jasmine, and amber that balances playful sweetness and lush sensuality in a way that anyone who's ever experienced love at first sight knows all too well. Against an opening pop of bright, juicy citrus, a fiery vein of ginger and saffron lends a dry, spicy elegance that leads seamlessly into the lush, romantic floral amber heart. The perfect proportions of sweet musk and creamy, woodsy vanilla prolong the sophistication, placing Instant Crush in the firmament of sweet, dry, spicy floral orientals that fans of classics like Baccarat Rouge 540 can't get enough of. But please, don't take our word for it- as you'd hope from a scent called Instant Crush, one sniff is likely all you'll need to turn your world upside-down."," Bergamot, mandarin, saffron, ginger, rose, jasmine, amber woods, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, oakmoss, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/649041.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Labyrinth Of Spices Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," Few world landmarks represent quite the smorgasboard of olfactory delights as the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. With over 4,000 shops across more than 60 covered streets, it's a veritable cornucopia of fragrant treasures, from spice and tea markets to exotic fruits to exquisite leather and woodwork. Labyrinth Of Spices, as you might expect, is a sweeping journey through this iconic and bustling marketplace and its many aromas- a treasure chest of sweets, spices, woods, and more- but for anyone who appreciates the sophistication of a gentler touch, we're pleased to report that the experience is as smooth and luxurious as a palanquin ride. Cardamom-infused coffee, sweet clove, and fiery nutmeg anchor the rich bouquet of spices, while green galbanum and sharp lavender inject a bright, fresh balance. ultimately, a wave of smooth, gently musky woods bring everything together in a soothing, surprisingly cohesive scent that feels like a representation of the Grand Bazaar as a whole. In other words, explore this Labyrinth to your heart's content- we promise you'll find your way to the other side."," Turkish coffee, pineapple, galbanum, tobacco, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, lavender, tonka, cardamom, amber, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, oakmoss, woody musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ottoman Treasure Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," As the center of Sultanic power during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul's Topkapi Palace is a majestic and sprawling complex, one that could be explored over a lifetime without ever fully revealing its secrets. Ottoman Treasure, the latest from Alghabra, gives this marvelous Palace the tribute it deserves with a rich, complex, compelling oriental scent with plenty of hidden depth of its own. A quick glimpse at the listed notes should give you some sense of what you're in for- there's hardly a traditional top note to be found. Instead, Ottoman Treasure emerges right from the bottle in a hypnotic swirl of smoky white oud and resinous labdanum, lightened only with the gentler smoke of pure olibanum incense and a spicy pop of pink pepper berries. But even with additional notes of earthy patchouli and golden amber in the mix, the composition, like the Palace itself, always leaves space beneath the high-vaulted ceilings for exploration and discovery, as a distinctively mossy basenote keeps overt heaviness at bay despite the powerful richness. Mysterious, regal, intriguing- Ottoman Treasure is everything something seeking a complex yet wearable oriental could ever hope for."," White oud, cistus labdanum, patchouli, olibanum, pink pepper, gurjun balsam, amber, moss, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Sapphire Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," The Imperial State Crown and Sceptre of the United Kingdom, the most precious of the Crown Jewels, share a signature stone- the sapphire. It is the awe-inspiring beauty and resonant depth of this precious, prodigious gemstone that makes up the inspiration for Royal Sapphire, an opulent blend of fruits, florals, and ambered woods that manages to delight and enchant all at once. True to its name, Royal Sapphire opens regal and sparkling, with a stunningly perfect top note of bergamot- sparkling, bright, sophisticated- paired with sweet, juicy mandarin. This mouthwatering duo only increases in potency as a dynamic and lovely orange blossom-led white floral heart adds romantic and regal depth. As a rich amber blends with dry woods in the base, the effect is mesmerising- a fragrance lively and joyful enough to captivate lovers of fruity florals and gourmands, yet as sophisticated as the Crown Jewels themselves. In short- Royal Sapphire is a gem you simply must add to your private collection."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, ambergris, patchouli, moss, amber, dry wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kintsugi Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," ""Cherish the simple. Cherish the old. Do not hide your scars, show them with pride.""This simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures the ethos behind the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, or Kintsukuroi, which repairs broken pottery using gold-infused lacquer, highlighting instead of obfuscating the cracks and celebrating the beauty and strength of imperfection. With this as inspiration, Masque Milano and perfumer Vanina Muracciole delivers a ""rediscovered"" chypre, pieced back together with a golden vein of suede leather that both restores and reimagines the structure of the style. Traditional elements of bright, bracing bergamot and rich, refined patchouli remain, but oakmoss has been replaced with a salty, savory amber accord that complements the glowing suede heart with an unmistakable fine-grain shimmer. A lovely touch of femininity comes by way of fresh, elegant Grasse rose centifolia and watery magnolia, while the aforementioned patchouli- fractionally distilled to strip away the mustiest aspects- rebalances the composition to sophisticated, unisex bliss. Whether you're a chypre lover looking for a loving reinterpretation, or simply a fan of Masque Milano's elegant yet unpretentious, creator-driven fragrances, Kintsugi is every bit the sparkling treasure its name makes it out to be."," Bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Osmanthus Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," While always beautiful, many osmanthus scents carry a hint of melancholy- a trend that Ormonde Jayne's Osmanthus EDP refreshingly sidestepped by creating an osmanthus fragrance bursting with sweet citrus and fresh, crisp florals- a sunlit delight. Osmanthus Elixir knows better than to temper that joyful sensation, and this Parfum does indeed have every bit of the intoxicating citrus pop of the original, meshing with fiery pepper and wild green notes to create a truly ecstatic energy that redefines osmanthus as a floral of brightness and cheer. But the added concentration of the Elixir also allows for a new depth and profundity- a woody, ambered fortitude to the base that provides more richness than the original, all without sacrificing a single ray of sunshine. Sparkling, romantic, and full of joy, Osmanthus Elixir is bliss in a bottle. What We Think All the wonderful brightness and sophisticated, fun florals of the original, with vastly improved longevity and a touch of amber."," Pomelo, davana, pimento, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine, cedar, labdanum, musk, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77756.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isfarkand Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand has always had a unique alchemy to its formula- on paper, it's a simple combination of citrus, cedar, and vetiver, and yet there's an abiding magic to how it wears on skin- clean, bright, modern, and transparent, each note blends into those surrounding it to create an enveloping, energizing, modern, and yet supremely easy going potion- a true ""aura"" of stylish and casual panache perfect for almost any situation. Isfarkand Elixir knows not to mess too much with a good thing, but the added Parfum strength gives us a chance to eat our cake and still have it too- while the citrus top still sparkles brightly, a more concentrated cedar note now hums with soft yet potent energy- a rebalance that adds significant longevity and a new layer of complexity in the base. All of style that made you fall in love with Isfarkand the first time, and now even more substance to match. What We Think Still very much the fresh, woodsy, modern Isfarkand we love, with much improved longevity and stronger cedar."," Lime, mandarin, bergamot, iso-e super, cedar, vetiver, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77757.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ta'if Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," The Ta'if rose- greener, spicier, more vibrant than the lusher European varietals- was the perfect centerpiece to the original Ta'if EDP, where sweet spice and gentle, watery florals defined a light, elegant rose scent with a restrained touch of gourmand exoticism. In Elixir form, however, a dramatic new element emerges with the addition of precious Cambodian oudh, which introduces a rich, warm, animalic sensuality. While it'd be hard to argue that this doesn't add some heaviness to a previously lighter-than-air composition, we urge you to think of Ta'if Elixir as its own, separate fragrance- one where the oudh turns the peppery florals into something sweepingly romantic and thoroughly, three-dimensionally gorgeous. Ta'if Elixir is a scent to be worn with reckless abandon, a breathtaking perfume of tremendous presence and timeless elegance. What We Think Quite different from the airy, subtle Ta'if EDP, and miles apart from a typical rose-oud combination as well. Deep, rich, and authentically warm and animalic."," Pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77758.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum was, and is, a head-turner. From the surprisingly bright green and citrus opening to the sweet and spicy florals, it was a decidedly new kind of amber scent- all of the dreamy indulgence of amber, but none of the heaviness. Royal Elixir doesn't mess with a perfect thing, and so the key notes of Ambre Royal are unaltered- bergamot, jasmine, amber, patchouli. And yet, when concentrated to parfum strength for the Elixir, new heights of complexity are reached- sweet, fresh, warm, and powdery elements intertwine with hypnotic power. And just like that, one of our all time favorite amber scents gets even more unique. What We Think Like the original Ambre Royal, a sophisticated, elegant floral amber- the Elixir concentration brings out the full lushness of the romantic florals and the powdered richness of the tonka and patchouli."," Green notes, orange, bergamot, jasmine, rose, amber, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77759.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ormonde Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," The signature Ormonde Man & Woman eaux de parfum are famous for a reason- featuring a distinctively seductive note of black hemlock, their spicy, aromatic sophistication was, and remains, a breath of fresh air. Now, Ormonde Jayne has taken the shared DNA of both Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman and produced Ormonde Elixir, a truly stunning, altogether new interpretation. The famed black hemlock is back, along with aromatic cedar and rich cardamom, but in the Elixir, a warm, sensual note of exquisite Cambodian oudh finds alluring, animalic new depth. There's never been a better way to experience the signature of this stunning house. What We Think The distinctive aromatic freshness and spice of Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman- already quite sexy!- gets an upgrade in both sensuality and sophistication with a perfect complement of warm, strong, just-the-right-amount-of-animalic oudh."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, cedar, amber, sandalwood, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77760.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Neroli Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," The Queen of Niche, the Queen of French Perfume- there are so many titles one could give to the astoundingly accomplished Patricia de Nicolai, but perhaps her favorite is a simple one: the Queen of Neroli. Indeed, she is an unquestioned master of every facet of the orange tree, from the soothingly fresh blossom to the bitter stem to the juicy fruit, and her mastery is entirely on display in Neroli Intense, which features every aspect of the orange tree- neroli, orange, petitgrain- in a beautifully fresh, lushly floral, utterly intoxicating fragrance. Pittosporum flower enriches the white floral elegance, while beeswax absolute and hints of patchouli and white musk add depth. If you love the classic beauty and freshness of neroli, Neroli Intense is a must try."," Neroli, mandarin, orange, tarragon, pittosporum, petitgrain, patchouli, musk, beeswax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313059.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Brume du Matin Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," For a house that made its name with rich, vintage-feeling compositions and extraordinary oud, Fragrance du Bois sure does know how to make a delightful fresh scent as well. The latest example is Brume du Matin, a gorgeously delicate summer floral that truly does capture the refreshing bliss of a misty seaside morning. Brume du Matin opens with a perfect evocation of the first rays of sun piercing the marine layer, as mandarin and bergamot shine through a smooth, foglike heart of soft summer florals and juicy but deliberately unsweetened peach and plum. Peony lovers especially should swoon at the lush, playful tones of the floral bouquet, which in turn lead into a gently creamy base of soft woods, amber, and white musk that resonate comfort long after the real fog has given way to summer sunshine. Fresh, fun, and deeply soothing, Brume du Matin is simply lovely."," Mandarin, bergamot, peach, plum, rose, violet, jasmine, peony, amber, woods, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir de Chine Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," In Les IndÃ©modables' Cuir de Chine (”œChinese Leather”), the usually delicate, apricot-faceted osmanthus note is boldly paired with a beautifully fresh and realistic tobacco leaf to create an accord.The result? Delicate yet assertive, classic yet modern, light as spring yet redolent of a tobacconists's leather-and-wood scented atelier, Cuir de Chine is a seamless balancing act of opposites that smoothly draws you into its elegant, romantic world that almost incites visions of sepia-tinted daguerreotype photographed flowers.As Cuir de Chine dries down and continues to bloom on skin, the oscillation between fresh and funky continues apace, as a fatty and indolic jasmine and bright herbal clary sage echo the osmanthus and tobacco leaf pairing to create what almost smells like an aromatic Chinese tea softened with milk, or curiously, even perfume-scented money.There's no doubt everyone's skin will highlight a different aspect of this paradoxical perfume, but one thing is for sure”” it will smell amazing."," Chinese osmanthus absolute 1%, Chinese osmanthus“alcoolat” Grand Cru 10%, Turkish“tabac blond” absolute .2%, Alpine clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

In the talented hands of Vanina Murraciole, this exquisite soliflore is a portrait not only of Grasse's most treasured native flower, but of the region itself, bursting with vivacious natural beauty and deeply romantic effect. A perfect dash of vibrant spice and a sweet, crisp candied apple note enhance the inherent freshness of Centifolia, while a smoothly musky base brings in a touch of Bulgarian rose to supplement the deeper, more carnal floral tones. The result is a true rose soliflore, showcasing the sublime simplicity of letting something naturally luxurious speak for itself.

Cuoio Dei Dolci Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Literally translating to ""Sweet Leather,  "" Cuoio dei Dolci is a rare kind of hybrid- one that draws equally from the smoky animalic intensity of leather and the mouthwatering richness of a gourmand to create a perfectly balanced,   exquisitely sensual treasure. This 100% natural confection,   described by none other than Luca Turin as ""a gingerbread ottoman that hits all the buttons,  "" features a heavy dose of castoreum as its primary ingredient- intense,   animalic,   and primally erotic. But lest you worry that Cuoio dei Dolci tilts too far towards the carnal,   a luxurious counterweight of powdered,   vanillic tonka softens the harsh edges,   joining a sweet,   naturalistic tobacco leaf to refine the leather and stir the senses. Supplemental notes of earthy cocoa,   smooth vanilla,   and sweet ylang add to the indulgent sophistication,   while a base of robust,   creamy sandalwood keeps everything at the perfect intersection of the dining room and the smoking parlor.

Notorious Oud Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," With Notorious Oud,  D.S. & Durga pay tribute to one of the greatest legends to ever emerge from their home borough of Brooklyn- Christopher Wallace,  better known as The Notorious B.I.G. But if you think the inspiration is merely surface level,  you're dead wrong- like the charming,  rough-edged,  impossibly clever rhymes of Frank White himself,  Notorious Oud showcases a versatile and often misunderstood fragrant ingredient with the type of irreverent panache that leaves competitors sputtering like the Madd Rapper. Biggie references aside,  how does Notorious Oud actually smell? Start with the oud itself,  a rich Indonesian specimen (""smell the Indonesia, "" as the great man once rapped) with a robust balance of smoky,  earthy,  and animalic tones. Afghani saffron and white galbanum enhance the green,  spicy energy,  while a lush Bulgarian rose feels as smooth and suave as Big Poppa. We could go on,  but we'll leave you instead with one last Biggie quote to capture how we feel about Notorious Oud: ""Stay far from timid/only make moves when your heart's in it/and live the phrase sky's the limit..."""," Saffron, camphor, white galbanum, oud, rose, lavender, civet, cetalox, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/686084.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Fougere Emeraude Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," A tuberose fougÃ¨re. That's not something you hear about every day, but once you smell it in FougÃ¨re Emeraude, it seems like the perfect way to both highlight and steer this floral note in an interesting direction that deconstructs the gender categories a floral or a fougÃ¨re would ordinarily suggest.But if you love tuberose, don't worry, FougÃ¨re Emeraude hands it to you in a hefty 15 percent dose, with all of its sweet creaminess and subtle green accents.

Gentle fluidity Silver Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Gentle fluidity – note the small f – is part of perfumer Francis Kurkdjian's experiment to see what happens when you set out with an identical set of notes but head off in two separate directions. The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver) – that prove that a painter's palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the master's art – one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the fresher of this charming duo. Immediately, the fresh gin-and-tonic fizz of juniper berry dominates, followed closely by a spiced woody note that's not quite as sharp as pine but still redolent of the cool, aromatic aroma of a coniferous forest. The coriander lends a metallic, peppery sheen to the woods that lifts the ashy greenness of the traditional fougÃ¨re-like accord in the heart and modernizes it for the young professional we see this fitting to a T. Crisp, fresh, and with a certain champagne-like sparkle that connects the dots to its warmer, richer Gold counterpart, Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the kind of scent you can dress up with a white shirt and tie, or dress down in khakis, and it will never be less than perfect."," Juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49887.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver) – that prove that a painter's palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the master's art – one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.gentle Fluidity (Gold) is the richer, more indulgent counterpart in the series. The sharp, aromatic freshness of the juniper and coriander of Gentle fluidity (Silver) has been dialed right back to allow the lush, almost syrupy vanilla-amber pairing take center stage, filling the air with its assertively sweet creaminess. The spice in gentle Fluidity is subtle but noticeable, the coriander berry in particular lending a gently champagne-like fizz that lifts the sultry vanilla pudding accord and gives it a metallic sparkle. Warm, sensuous, and as cozy as a cat on a lap, gentle Fluidity (Gold) is just the kind of thing you need when the world is all sharp angles and hard elbows."," Juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49888.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oriental Velours Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," Oriental Velours is as plush as its name suggests, plunging you into a hypnotic reverie of warm, spicy resins, creamy vanilla, and aromatic notes recalling bracing woods and pine needles. Its centerpiece is myrrh, with its woody, subtle licorice facet which finds resonance with vanilla and what smells like a hint of cinnamon. Although the church incense quality of myrrh isn't overdone here, there's certainly enough to subliminally suggest rituals and to possibly incite devotion at its perfumed altar.An almost smoky vetiver pulls the warm notes of Oriental Velours together with its brightness and elegance, adding some lightness to the otherwise nocturnal character of this fragrance.

Musk Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," When you have access to raw materials as exceptionally high quality as those used in Bortnikoff scents, the word ""cologne"" should never be mistaken to mean a fragrance is light or fleeting. Instead, it's an invitation to discover the tremendous amount of depth that the traditionally fresh style can contain- something we first learned with their ambergris-laden Amber Cologne. But Musk Cologne is something else altogether, an arresting combination of vibrant citrus, smooth florals, and rich, warm musk that thrums with sensual energy that simply must be experienced to be believed. Gently spicy, subtly smoky, and compellingly animalic, this is a musk note of remarkable sophistication, so striking that it upends the staid expectations for an eau-de-cologne style fragrance and reinvents it as something potent and seductive, even while maintaining a cheerful and energetic exterior. Or to put it another way- you've never smelled a cologne quite like this."," Bergamot, lemon, tangerine, sweet orange, green tea, lily of the valley, magnolia, tuberose, ylang ylang, deer musk, sandalwood, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandarino di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," With so many wonderful new citrus fragrances available this summer, what makes Mandarino di Sicilia stand out from the crowd? The answer might sound silly but, well- it's the mandarin. Specifically, three unique fractional essential oils of mandarin- delicate, nuanced green mandarin, rich, juicy yellow mandarin, and a third distillation capturing a bitter, bracing orange essence. The result is a dazzling portrait of citrus in full, further enhanced with petitgrain and orange blossom, and given form and weight with fruity amber and a dashing note of geranium. Fresh, bright, and sophisticated, Mandarino di Sicilia is a burst of citrus sunshine for even the most discerning tastes."," Green mandarin, bitter orange, yellow mandarin, petitgrain, Jasmin, geranium, orange blossom, cedar, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702051.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bergamotto di Calabria Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," The oldest and most revered method for extracting Calabrian bergamot oil is performed by hand using a specially curved knife and a natural sponge. It's a painstaking process, requiring 200kg of fruit for a single litre of essential oil, and thus it is rarely employed today, but it sidesteps the quality control issues inherent in mechanical extraction to produce a fragrant essence of the most delicate, complex quality, a perfect blend of tart, juicy freshness and smooth, sophisticated floral tones. It's this uniquely exceptional bergamot that defines the character of Bergamotto di Calabria, supplemented with a fiery jolt of ban timur and pink peppers, smoothed with a delicate white floral heart, and given warm, creamy depth with a musky sandalwood base. It's the absolute best that the old ways have to offer, made exceptional with just a touch of the new."," Bergamot, petitgrain, timur pepper, pink pepper, orange flower, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, iris, sandalwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arancia di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," In perfumery the essential oil from bitter oranges carries greater value than that of more common sweeter varieties. The Sanguinella Orange is the exception to the rule due to its exceptionally high quality. Cultivated on the slopes of Mount Etna, the fruit grown here stands out due to its intense red color and complex, aromatic sweetness. In Arancia di Sicilia, the pure essence of this dynamic citrus is brought to life through two laborious manual extraction processes whose oils are blended together to produce an accord which fuses the energy and character of citrus with an enveloping natural sweetness. The scent's heart is enhanced with almond, vanilla and cinnamon, followed by base notes revealing soft musk and amber, and then finally the intense aroma of coffee absolute. Arancia Di Sicilia celebrates the flavors and scents of Sicily, creating the warm atmosphere of Sicilian mornings, the flavor of invigorating orange juice and the sweetness of pure candy- a tribute to the island and a delight for the senses."," Blood orange (brown extraction & sfuma torchio extraction), almond, cinnamon, labdanum, coffee, iris, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soleil d'Italie Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Spicy, sexy, and blissfully sunny, Soleil d'Italie is a delightful romp across the Italian coastline. Modern yet timeless, it combines effervescent notes of bright and juicy citrus with sweet, light rose, and spicy vetiver to produce a fragrance of dynamic freshness. As it dries, a warm, soothing amber perfectly evokes the deeply comforting feeling of sun-soaked skin after a long day of outdoor revelry. Sensual and impressively long-lasting, Soleil d'Italie feels like it's destined to become a modern summertime go-to, the kind of simple, yet unforgettable scent perfect for every beach day, backyard party, and road trip from now until the leaves change.

Safran Colognise Extrait de Cologne,Nishane," Since its debut last year, Nishane's Colognise- a lovely and invigorating re-imagining of the fresh lemon cologne kept on-hand in most Turkish households- has been an office favorite, a striking yet casual scent perfect for any situation. Now, with Safran Colognise, they've brought back the core of the fragrance with a pronounced dash of fiery saffron, and the result is strikingly unique- a fragrance with the delightful energy of the original, but a robust, exotic character all its own. Safran Colognise's bright, citrussy opening will be familiar to fans of the original, but it arrives right away with a twist all its own- the tropical juiciness of passionfruit, which helps open the palate to the rich spiciness of saffron, combined with pink pepper for a powerful heart that maintains an airy freshness- less herbaceous than its predecessor but still recognizable and bright. A drydown that adds salty ambergris and leather to the mix preserves the spicy power, while also adding some additional longevity to the musky formula of the original. Robust and vivacious, Safran Colognise is an intoxicating new take on a classic."," Cedrat, passion fruit, pink grapefruit, saffron, magnolia, pink pepper, musk, ambergris, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Chant de Camargue Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The desalinated marshes of the Camargue region of France are known for the treasured ""wild"" red rice cultivated there- and the gorgeous pink flamingos drawn to the amber-colored plants. Le Chant de Camargue, the newest from L'Artisan and perfumer Alberto Morillas, captures the unique character of this magical location, delivering a subtle and beautiful fragrance  that evokes the delicately floral, subtly earthy, soothingly creamy aromas one might experience on a stroll through a real rice paddy. Using the fresh. gently smoky tones of bergamot to set the scene, Le Chant de Camargue quickly reveals a smoothly powdery heart of rice, an accord built from scratch by Morillas to capture the uniquely nutty texture of Camargue red rice. The rice's mouthwateringly milky tones are further supplemented with the sandalwood milk accord of the base, prolonging the woody and creamy elements of the rice and bringing the intensity of the still-noticeable bergamote back into play. The cumulative effect is compellingly dreamlike, delicately mouthwatering, and subtly invigorating- a true journey through a beautiful and distinctive corner of France as only L'Artisan could provide."," Bergamot, Carmargue rice, sandalwood milk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Petales de Cashmere Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," A celebration of luxurious softness, Petales de Cashmere is an elegant floral of dreamlike comfort. Bright, luscious citrus meld into an exotic bouquet of jasmine, rose, and violet, invigorated by savory notes of saffron and caraway that sparkle like a warm summer day. In a deep, musky base, creamy sandalwood lends a velvet touch, while a deliciously resinous olibanum incense note gives us a brush with the mystical. As with any good dream, Petales de Cashmere has no sharp edges, each delightful note existing instead in complete harmony, the feeling of almost primal well-being lingering for hours on the skin. After all, don't we all deserve a little bliss in our day?"," Mandarin, grapefruit, jasmine, rose, violet, saffron, caraway, musk, olibanum, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A Man's Cologne Eau de Parfum,Gravel," There are fragrances that are defined by their era, and then there are fragrances that outlast their own era and become immortal. Gravel is just such a fragrance. Originally invented by Michael Knudsen in 1957, Gravel A Man's Cologne was a different sort of men's scent right from the start- sold exclusively at select boutiques and featuring a distinctive profile- fresh, fruity citrus that transitions into a never-too-heavy blend of balsamic woody notes. The base blends powdery tonka, a secret selection of spices, and a mineralic, lightly industrial aura of incense and vetiver that does indeed call to mind the name of the fragrance- and yes, those are real pieces of gravel in the bottle, perhaps imbuing their own unique character over time. The result is a scent that we'd imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago. Gravel A Man's Cologne is, by any standard, a legendary scent. Who couldn't use one of those in their life?"," Bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Villa Nellcote Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""Never has a house been so closely associated with the creation of a rock album. This was a summer that would change the history of music forever. The fragrance Villa Nellcote is the embodiment of the magnificent garden and surroundings at the estate with the same name."" -Johan Bergelin Villa Nellcote, a 19th-century mansion overlooking Villefranche Bay on France's Cote d'Azur, has what could generously be called a colorful past- after serving as a Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of France, the Villa was reclaimed for ""allied"" debauchery when it was famously rented in the summer of 1971 to serve as the party palace and studio of the Rolling Stones as they recorded their classic album Exile On Main Street. Using the lushly landscaped grounds as an inspiration, Villa Nellcote the fragrance is a smooth, confident unisex floral, boasting a bouquet of lush flowers enriched with a piquant blend of fresh green citrus and spice. We picture ourselves atop the grand outdoor staircase overlooking the lavish gardens, with a subtly smoky base of black tea, patchouli and woods the only indication of the rock-star hedonism happening in the cellar-turned-studio, hidden away from prying eyes. For those who like their summertime freshness with just a hint of naughtiness, Villa Nellcote is a perfect tribute to a locale that will forever live in rock-n-roll infamy."," Grapefruit, bergamot, petitgrain, pink pepper, elemi, lemon, lemon flower, violet, rose, jasmine, magnolia, osmanthus, black tea, cabreuva, cedar, patchouli, white amber, musk, moss, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Portrayal Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to himself. A reflection of his unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. It is an olfactive depiction of bohemian culture. Its woody and leather aroma exudes an air of exquisite audacity. It is about the arrogance and social tension in the world's cultural discourse. With Vetiver at its heart and top notes of Violet Leaves, Portrayal Man emits a dandy yet masculine impression."," Violet Leaves, Vetiver, Cade",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/418095.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Portrayal Woman,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to herself. A reflection of her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional. Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Portrayal Woman is for the poised and playfully refined woman who dares to defy. With a smoky yet sweet mÃ©lange created by the fusion of Craven ”˜A' Tobacco with a dusting of Vanilla, this scent is brought together with Jasmine at its top, Elemi at its base and heartened with Tuberose, recreating the 1920's liberation movement."," Jasmine, Vanilla, Tabacco, Tuberose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/418096.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Humus Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Darkly earthy yet humming with subtle musky energy, Humus is a primally comforting scent. The richness of volcanic topsoil is evoked through a blend of cool, earthy mushroom, smooth oakmoss, and grassy, gently spicy vetiver, while a sharp violet and aromatic pine provide sophisticated depth, capped with a uniquely mineralic, chalky pebble note. The effect is hyper-natural: unmistakably the scent of ancient earth and new growth, but experienced through an invigorating aromatic mist, alluring and mysterious. An utterly elemental experience."," Violet, oakmoss, mushroom, pebbles, pine tree, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/752005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc des Sables Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," What do you get when you combine two of the costliest ingredients in perfumery””ambergris and orris””with animalic musks and spices? In Antoine Lie's hands, a mysteriously sexy elixir that melts into skin, leaving a sheer but substantial trace of fairy dust that's subtly sweet, spicy, sensuous, and ever-evolving.Musc des Sables opens with a fresh, bright mandarin note that seamlessly transitions into cozy, spiced opulence. Ambergris in contemporary, even luxury perfumes, is mostly synthetic due to its price and scarcity, but the ambergris at Musc des Sables' heart””tinctured from authentic ambre gris (grey amber) through a 6-month process done specifically for Les IndÃ©modables at its founders' lab””pulsates with sensuality and complexity. Anyone who's smelled this classical perfume ingredient in its authentic form in vintage or bespoke formulas will recognize it here as the real deal for its earthy, animalic and even tabacco-like warmth that leaves its trace hours into wearing it. Combined with creamy orris, spices, patchouli and musk, Musc des Sables' heady formula somehow maintains a diaphanous””yet persistent”” lightness. Pure magic."," Italian green mandarin, Indonesian patchouli Grand Cru, Ambergris tincture, Orris absolute Grand Cru, Benzoin, cardamom, cinnamon, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Perle Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," Like some beautiful faces so gorgeous you're not sure what feature to pay attention to first, the elegant Iris Perle is an embarrassment of riches.Perhaps the first thing you notice is coolness, as if elegance turned itself into silk, shimmering in the light. The multifaceted mimosa bloom, so fresh and representative of that honeyed floral you'd think its scent was radiating from under your nose by the warmth of the sun, combines with sultry jasmine and bright ylang-ylang. Maybe the violet leaves or clary sage that keep the composition fresh catch your attention first, or the huge amount of the most expensive perfume ingredient in the world””orris, the sensual backdrop to Iris Perle that is at once earthy, cool, sensual, and creamy.Whatever it is you notice first, or all at once, these are not ordinary ingredients. They're the Platonic Ideal, whose journey from plant to bottle was ushered with experience and care by their founders. The Moroccan mimosa absolute in Iris Perle is extracted in their lab from carefully hand-selected flower buds only, whereas the entire flower and stem is usually used in other perfumes with mimosa notes. This accounts for its smooth, rich floralcy that edits out unwanted herbaceous qualities. And from the time it's planted until it's extracted, it takes seven years for orris root to deliver its oil, like a pearl in the world of perfumery. Iris Perle gets its French orris from“grand cru” crops exclusive to Les IndÃ©modables.Antoine Lie has wrested from all of these superior ingredients their most singing and luscious qualities, leaving for the dramatic backdrop a kind of textural perfume: rich, buttery, gleaming, and smooth, like an iridescent pearl."," French orris absolute grand cru, Morrocan mimosa absolute, Indian jasmine absolute, Madagascan ylang-ylang, Clary sage from the Alps",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose de Jamal Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables," Rose de Jamal asks you to rethink this iconic perfume note,  long consigned in the mainstream perfume imagination as something stodgy,  old fashioned,  and too conventionally feminine. And one whiff of it will have you feeling,  to borrow a song lyric,  like a perfume virgin,  sniffing rose as if for the very first time. Its avant-garde construction by perfumer Antoine Lie takes the Moroccan damascena rose absolute at its heart far away from its classical use,  thanks largely to its pairing with a special Moroccan“Naneh” mint,  a variety of spearmint especially sweet and aromatic and used in Moroccan drinks and teas. Although this mint might move Rose de Jamal toward a“masculine” fougÃ¨re,  it perhaps ideally helps to deconstruct any ingrained ideas of gender in rose,  producing only the more perfume-centric thought,  This is beautiful.Rose de Jamal is also unusual for its massive 5.5% dose of Moroccan rose absolute. In addition there are 500 grams of freshly harvested rose buds per bottle of Rose de Jamal ”” the equivalent of more than 100 roses. Smelling Rose de Jamal might also produce the feeling of smelling rose for the very first time,  Lie has suggested in interviews,  because its realness is radically different from the scent of synthetically constructed rose accords in most perfumes with rose. The rose here is lush,  velvety,  almost suede-like,  subliminally pulling you into its mysterious heart even as you might only be smelling its lush beauty. What also makes Rose de Jamal special is its name: named after the Les IndÃ©modable exclusive partner in Morocco,  Jamal Chaboun,  who produces this special Rose harvest (among other ingredients). Jamal owns his plantations,  controls the crops,  and has mastered extraction processes.”œJamal loves his business and is very proud of his raw materials, ” Lie said in an interview.“We decided to make a perfume homage to the gentleman,  to take him from the shadows.”"," Moroccan damascene rose absolute, Moroccan cedarwood, Madagascan pink pepper C02, Morocan Naneh mint, lavender",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pineapple Essenza Eau de Parfum,Panah London," If the word pineapple makes you feel like you know what's coming, let us assure you- Pineapple Essenza isn't another Aventus clone. Instead, it's a fizzy, fruity, woodsy delight of a unisex cocktail, a dose of flirtatious summertime fun that lovers of unique freshies should take care not to miss. Pineapple Essenza opens with- you guessed it- pineapple, in this instance a note that plays with both the sweet and tart aspects of the fruit, enhanced with a jolt of icy Sicilian lemon and a tangy twist of blackcurrant, giving it chypre-like aromatic qualities without sacrificing an ounce of refreshment. A gently sweet tonka note leads into a smoothly musky-woodsy base, deepening the sophisticated yet straightforward character and ensuring enough depth to make this tropical delight a year-round go-to. Let go of your preconceptions and dive into Pineapple Essenza- thank us for the smile you can't get rid of later."," Pineapple, Sicilian lemon, blackcurrant, lily, tonka, patchouli, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/828002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Brandied Pear Eau de Parfum,Panah London," Panah has quickly gained our attention for scents that effortlessly balance delectable gourmand elements with an everyday wearable lightness, and Brandied Pear may be the best of the bunch. Boasting a succulent, refreshing fruitiness to offset the dessert's decadent construction, this is less a gourmand, and more a fruit-forward delight with just enough vanillic sweetness to leave us swooning. The central player is, we're happy to confirm, the pear- mouthwatering, gently spiced, and sweetened not with syrupy sugar but rather just a touch of ripe banana. Only after we've had some time to exult in this perfect pear does it get the after-dinner treatment- a simmer in rich, warm, boozy brandy and a drizzle of indulgent vanilla cream. All the while, zesty lemon, verdant green leaves, and a wisp of soft musk keep things fresh and not too sweet, ensuring its unisex appeal. Pear lovers, this one's calling your name- don't miss out."," Lemon, banana, pear, green leaves, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/828004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nefs Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Like Istanbul itself, the masterful creations of Nishane straddle the line between Europe and Asia, synthesizing the palettes and traditions of both in the service of dynamic, modern perfumery. And so it's unsurprising that Nefs, conceptualized as the line's flagship oriental scent, wouldn't be content to simply recycle the genre's standard spicy floral opulence, but would instead strive for a new, modern oriental- an East-meets-West portrait of refined luxury to sway even those who dislike oriental fragrances.  Keep in mind that when we say luxurious, we mean it- this is Nishane's most indulgently constructed fragrance yet, with authentic aged oud, exquisite harvests of rose, jasmine, and osmanthus, and a vibrant, saffron-led spice bouquet. Gently sweetened with honey and the balanced booziness of whiskey, the florals and spice stay lively on the skin, subverting any associations of oriental scents with oppressive heaviness or vintage stuffiness. A rich, smooth, gently gourmand woodsy base adds a sensual touch of modernity. Like a breeze blowing from the east across the Bosporus, Nefs is an exquisite oriental that bridges the gap between civilizations."," Honey, violet, sage, saffron, fig, rose, osmanthus, geranium, jasmine, nutmeg, amber, whiskey, oud, cinnamon, cedar, gurjam balsam, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Megamare Parfum,Orto Parisi," A portrait of the beauty that lies on the surface of the ocean, and the dangers of the salty depths below. Megamare is a swirling typhoon of a scent, a heady wash of brackish water, biting green algae, spicy-sweet sea air, and a sparkling musk that radiates with the intensity of the midday sun reflecting off the rolling waves of the open ocean. With immense longevity and powerful projection. Tranquil and terrifying, serene and sensual, Megamare radiates the yin and yang of the sea.","Spicy, Sweet, Sparkling Musk, Oceany",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mahabah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Mahaba, meaning“love” but also“charity” in Arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. A bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. In the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. Mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends Un Bois Vanille (Serge Lutens) its mysterious darkness. Later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. Feminine, lovely, and unusual, Mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing."," petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shaghaf Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in Arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the Anfas crown. The simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis – a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business – in the heart of a Middle Eastern city. Shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.Shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. The spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the Ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. But soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. Slowly, a worn leather note emerges – or maybe it is black tea – thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. Shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the Middle East to smell like. But for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. With its toasty, sandy texture, Shaghaf occupies the same headspace as Fidelis (by Histoires de Parfum), Nanban (Arquiste), and Songe d'Un Bois en EtÃ© (Guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. Silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but Shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. With the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. Color us impressed – this bad boy is a Muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it."," cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Ishq Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"“I cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and I cannot express my love for you. You are me, I move with you”. Red ISHQ is perfumer Asim Al Qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. Accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron – dry, slightly bitter – is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. Think Tuscan Leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.Oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. The drydown of Red ISHQ features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of Encens Flamboyant (Annick Goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of Baccarat Rouge (Maison Francis Kurkdijan). Despite the pert raspberry note up front, Red ISHQ is completely unisex – a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water."," jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Green Gaya Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Bright, fresh, and unashamedly cheerful, Green Gaya whisks us on a journey to a true oasis, where its bounty of succulent fruit and spicy woods is all the richer for the vastness of the desert that surrounds it. Picture an exotic dessert, created from the ripest, juiciest fruits a kingdom could produce- sticky, mouthwatering mango and plump, smooth, gently floral pear, enhanced with a daring dose of sweet cardamom and rich star anise. A delectably creamy milk heart heightens the gourmand delicacy, while a balancing accord of crisp, stout cedarwood and a gentle touch of oud cut through the sweet and creamy notes to provide energy and structure. A warm amber base paired with dry iris suggests the stifling heat just outside of our hideaway, heightening the contrast and enhancing the refreshing vitality."," Anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Purple Sakan,ANFAS," Purple Sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. It is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. But as Purple Sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. Rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. Purple Sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of Asim al Qassim's Emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an Arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal."," Bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Watan Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," ""A story written with golden water... a history that cannot be erased...""Inspired by the feeling of pure luxury conveyed by both pure gold and pure oud, Gold Watan is a shimmering vision of romance and exoticism. From the first spray, its royal lineage is clear, as the top notes feature a rich, resinous, potent oud and cistus combination usually reserved for a scent's latter phases. In this instance, however, it proves the perfect introduction- powerfully evocative, yet so well balanced that the subtly sweet and smoky tones have room to shift and move, leading into an exuberant heart of woodsy, spicy nagarmotha and a smooth, multi-colored floral accord that adds softness to the oud's pungent authenticity. Pillowy musk and the perfect amount of mouthwatering, crystalline sugar complete the intriguingly parallel evolution of the scent, as the progression from rugged to refined happens with such designed subtlety that you may not realize quite what's happened until you find that you simply cannot stop sniffing your wrist. Sumptuous and authentic, yet delicious and delightful, Gold Watan is an unforgettable oud fragrance."," Cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahaba Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Rahaba is the Arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. In Arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously – and Rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. It opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. A fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. There is a touch of gin, too – but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. This barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. However, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find Rahaba tremendously inviting. The bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. The drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. Rahaba is, in its final hours, a mÃ©lange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk – perhaps Ambrox – that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy."," orange, gin, pineapple, Damask rose, Grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Samaha,ANFAS," Samaha, meaning tolerance and magnanimity in Arabic, is a modern Venus on a Half Shell. Picture a bosomy bouquet of freshly-cut flowers emerging from a fine misting of sea spray, and then wrapped in a cloud of soapy floral musks and the steamy vapors of feminine bathing rituals. Like its antecedents, Amouage Gold or Madame Rochas, Samaha is a classically feminine scent that manages to be refined and faintly suggestive at the same time. Flirting with the line between freshly-scrubbed and richly suggestive, it channels the classic triad of Grasse-grown jasmine, rose, and neroli through the red velvet corridor of a Parisian boudoir. There are no aldehydes here, nothing fusty or old-fashioned, and yet its perfumey cloud of abstract flowers and bathroomy musks clearly draws on a French tradition of perfumery. The key difference is the salty, lemony radiance that suffuses the structure with air and light – Samaha is full-bodied, but light, like the fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake you can imagine."," citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sa'adah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS," Sa'adah is an Arabic name for girls that means ”˜happiness'. And indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. Opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. Soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. We see Sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. Crucially, though, Sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to ”˜age' it. It is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. A warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. A happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal."," orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Splendour Perfume Concentrate,Goldfield & Banks," We absolutely adore mimosa-based scents, so when word arrived that the newest Goldfield & Banks would feature golden wattle, or Australian mimosa, we were delighted. But what we never could have anticipated is just how uniquely different from European mimosa golden wattle turns out to be- powdery and woodsy, with gentle tones of green fruit, this is a hearty and distinctive floral note all its own- one that truly captures the rugged beauty of the Flinders Ranges in Southern Australia where the wattle used in this fragrance is harvested. As Goldfield & Banks is so adept at accomplishing, every supplemental ingredient in this cheerfully complex floral brings out a new aspect of the golden wattle- bright, fresh mandarin, smooth orange blossom and jasmine, and soft, gently earthy woods produce a refined naturalism. If you're a mimosa lover looking for something you've never quite tried before, or if you're simply seeking a gorgeous and unique floral perfect for any occasion, Velvet Splendour is ray of warm sunshine."," Mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute (South Australia), orange blossom, jasmin sambac, Australian sandalwood, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Papyrus Oud Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 2003, Michel Almairac released the instantly iconic Gucci pour Homme, a boldly warm and woodsy men's scent featuring a proprietary ""papyrus wood"" accord that defied the fresh, synthetic trends of the time to become a modern classic. Now, almost two decades later, Almairac returns to his beloved creation through a niche fragrance lens- with an emphasis on smoky, spicy complexity- and the result is Papyrus Oud, a vision of masculine elegance and warm sophistication.The key to Papyrus Oud's timeless appeal is evident in the east-meets-west nature of its composition, with classically French floral and aromatic notes of lavender, geranium, oakmoss and jasmine injecting vibrant elegance into the luxuriously Middle Eastern melange of fiery spice, papyrus, agarwood, and incense. The result is a scent that feels full but never heavy, distinctive but smooth and surprisingly easy to wear- a true signature scent that, while leaning masculine, smells out-of-this-world good on just about anyone. Whether you've long missed Gucci pour Homme or are simply looking for something that casts aside the trends of the day for something better, Papyrus Oud is a gift from above."," Papyrus, Incense, Patchouli, Oud, Musk, Chocolate, Ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gardens of India Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. It's this latter philosophy that guides Gardens of India, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. As basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of Gardens of India is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer Michel Almairac spent refining the formula. It begins with jasmine buds, plucked in June and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. Tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. Finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. The scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. Take a walk through the Gardens of India- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there."," Jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blackpepper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Blackpepper is the pitch black of a starless sky rendered into perfume form. A perfect storm of“black” flavor molecules clash as if in a Super Collider – pungent black pepper, charred cedar, and smoky Akigala wood sparking off against each other and then pulling apart, over and over again. Wearing this scent is like slowly adjusting your eyes to pitch darkness; with time, an incredible wealth of detail is revealed. The fragrance is deep, hot, and oily, but at the same time, it's as dry as a bone. The burnt sugar of tonka bean softens the searing heat of the pepper, like the edge of a cedar log caramelizing on an open fire. A remarkably crisp, airy fragrance emerges phoenix-like from the hot ashes. Fierce enough to command attention, sophisticated enough to leave a lasting impression, Blackpepper is the kind of sexy, modern, avant-garde masterpiece that could only have come from Comme des GarÃ§ons."," Black pepper, cedar, patchouli, agarwood (oud), tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21646.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gosha Rubchinskiy Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," Gosha Rubchinskiy: Photographer, artist, and chronicler of Russian youth street culture. Comme des Garcons: The avant-garde designer that brought her art to the masses. Their first joint fragrance project: As edgy as one might expect. And like Rubchinskiy's clothes, this scent will evoke strong reactions. Inspired by skateboarding on a summer's day in an anonymous Russian city, Gosha Rubchinskiy for Comme des Garcons smells excitingly of lost youth: hot tar mingling with the scent of rubber wheels and the mineral spark of board against concrete. The blackcurrant tang of buchu tea lends a samovar-like flavor to proceedings, briefly flushing the monochromatic palette with rosy tannins. The memory of hot sidewalks and remembered freedom lurks within the cool, flinty vetiver and the dry, dusty patchouli. To be worn with a statement t-shirt and attitude."," Angelica root, buchu, mandarin seed, blue chamomile, styrax, Haitian vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21647.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Concrete Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," The maestros of the unexpected have again tackled a quotidian material and managed to tease apart the surprises that lie within the banal. Comme des Garcons' Concrete is, straightforwardly enough, housed in a grey shell of poured concrete, but uniquely hand-formed. Freed from the streets beneath our feet, concrete becomes a material worthy of observation and appreciation. And the enclosed scent, too, reveals in its first puff what happens when stereotypes are shattered. The first moments of Concrete are shocking – from this weighty concrete pebble, one would expect a harsh industrial scent, but instead, a cloud of soft-focused sherbert, melting in the street, greets the senses. This is Comme des Garcons at its most subtle, honed in on the slightest of details. In the ambiently fruity, lactonic haze, there's a metallic zing, contributed by rose oxide. Lightly spicy, with cinnamon and cardamom, this is a strange, fizzing scent. And as it progresses, the creaminess grows drier. There's an“aha!” moment when the mind connects the dots, and it becomes discernable as the most velvety of woods – sandalwood. What Comme des Garcons describes as a“deconstructed” sandalwood, Concrete is a scent that is more than the sum of its parts – identifiable, but still beautifully quixotic in its alignment. The industrial made natural, and nature deconstructed.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Andy Warhol's You're In Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," You're In - Say that three times fast, and you can't help but let out an impish laugh. The title of a 1967 artwork by the godfather of Pop Art, Andy Warhol, You're In consisted of Coca-Cola bottles spray-painted his classic silver, and filled with a strange citrus cologne akin to urine (get the pun?) Now reimagined as a chic fragrance by Comme des Garcons, You're In stays true to its avant-garde roots, from the sleek silvery bottle to the zingy, metallic scent within. In a nod to Andy Warhol's multiples, You're In is released as a singular scent but in different unique collectible bottles, inscribed with varying famous quotes by the artist. But the true star here is the fragrance itself - the top notes open in a thirst-quenching burst of bitter orange and zesty makrout lime bubbling atop Comme des Garcons' signature soapy-herbaceous aldehydes. It's a shimmering, scrubbed-clean kind of sophisticated, and completed with pittosporum, a hyper-concentrated twin of orange blossom, and a softening hint of jasmine. Like a cold splash of water from a technicolor fountain, Andy Warhol's You're In leaves a mark as iconic as old Andy himself.Please note that Andy Warhol's You're In is a singular fragrance, available in different packaging options - each with a specific quote on the bottle and box:""Art is what you can get away with.""""I never fall apart, because I never fall together.""""I never read, I just look at pictures.""""If everybody is not a beauty, then nobody is.""""In the future everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes."""," Bitter orange, aldehydes, makrut lime zest, jasmine, coriander leaf, pittosporum, cashmere wood, musk, metallic amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21648.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 01 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Second only to its sister scent Molecule 01, Escentric 01 boasts the highest concentration of the aroma chemical Iso E Super ever to be used in perfumery (65%).  The woody nature of this note is joined with top notes of pink pepper, lime peel and orris incense to create a moving fragrance intent on taking you right from the opening to the base in one sweeping, dramatic move. The tart lime and zesty pink pepper are a sparkling shot into the dark heart of Escentric 01's moody, soft wood nature, while orris incense adds a dash of smoky incense and turns up the heat.

Odeur 53 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," Mission: a scent that nobody recognized. Abstract. Lack of a been there, done that snooze-fest.In 1998, CdG stepped away from natural ingredients, seeking to clone the ultra-modern straight outta the manmade world. The result? Fifty three non-traditional notes comprise this masterpiece, resulting in a very recognizable scent of crisp air mixing with cotton-drying-in-the-wind. We think it smells like a brand-new car and warm, soft human skin-perfection. You may think it sounds strange until you realize just how many of the notes of Odeur 53 you know (and love). 'Cept for the nail polish part. We don't smell that at all."," oxygen, flash of metal, fire energy, washing drying in the wind, mineral carbon, sand dunes, nail polish, cellulose, pure air of the high mountains, ultimate fusion, burnt rubber, flaming rock",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odeur 71 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," The ultimate anti-perfume. The notes are inspired by dust on a hot lightbulb, bamboo, metal, electricity and lettuce juice...no lie! But what does it smell like? Surprisingly, it's a completely wearable scent; metal and electricity manifest as the invigorating smell of ozone just before a storm, and the combination of we-don't-know-what makes for a familiar soapy freshness. Hot laundry right out of the dryer served up on your clean, sexy Xerox machine. Released in 2000, Odeur 71 continues to make huge stir-not just for its revolutionary scent structure, but because it's a testament that a combination of the truly weird can make a truly fantastic fragrance."," incense, wood, moss, willow, elm, bay leaves, bamboo, hyacinth",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2 Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Ancient ink in the summer sun, #2 is a study in contrasts. Based on the legendary Sumi ink made in the temples of Japan, this seductive fragrance blends the seared wood notes of Sumi with spiritual scents of incense, patchouli and amber, then takes a turn toward the shiny n' happy with the bright notes of magnolia and ripe, fresh new aldehydes (orange and mandarin). We smell something different every time we wear this-it falls somewhere between a mighty Samurai and a humble priest with a jones for gardening. CdG #2 is presented in a silvered, reflective bottle that made Time Asia's Top 10 designs for 1999."," Japanese Sumi ink, incense, patchouli, cedarwood, angelica root, vetiver, magnolia, amber, labdanum, new aldehydes, cumin, cade oil, absolute matÃ©, abslolute folia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," A gentle re-imagining of CdG's signature Eau de Parfum, White unfolds in waves of light wood and spiced florals, perfect for any season. Anchored throughout by a soft cedarwood, White incorporates may rose and lily of the valley to lend softness, and adds the unusual topnote of pomegranate-which comes through as a peep of tart freshness in the beginning. Amber and vanilla add warmth and sensuality. If you're familiar with scents like 10 Corso Como, you'll recognize White as the forerunner to striking, woody florals with a kick."," spices, lily of the valley, may rose, pomegranate, vanilla, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2 MAN Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," The fragrance that's causing crazed mobs to empty the shelves in Europe and Japan is here!  CdG 2 MAN is a revision of the original 2 (in the silver bottle), taking it in a more woody/incense direction and creating a whole new animal.  Smoldering at first, 2 MAN roars out of the gate, declaring its boldness and contempt for simpering little focus-group scents that are a mishmash of ""manly"" notes.  2 MAN's simmering and incensey opening unfolds into an unusual combination of nutmeg, vetiver and subtle saffron flowers, each one appearing like chapters in a book.  As the pages turn and it evolves on the skin, a subdued mahogany and leather bring up the rear. Daring but not brash or loud; complex yet never persnickety.  It's a sure-bet for a modern classic."," incense, white smoke, saffron flowers, nutmeg, vetiver roots, mahogany,  leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Original Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," CdG's legendary eau de parfum was originally released in 1994 and considered by most CdG fans to be their finest. Eau de parfum is hailed as a fragrance that ""works like a medicine, behaves like a drug"". A sparkling array of spices awaken the senses, with notes of cinnamon, rose and clove. Like a balm, the scent invades the body--woody and resin work in concert with harmonies of honey and cedarwood.

3 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," What would a flower that didn't exist smell like? CdG3 was borne from a dream by its creator, in which an electric, incandescent flower shines out of a primordial, lava-filled nothingness. Completely living up to that Sci-Fi inspired dream, CdG3 is a fragrantly opalescent rendering of what it would be like to find a never before seen or imagined flower growing on another planet.  By turns bold and elusive, energetic and bewitching, the top and middle notes of black rose oxide, mace, angelica and basil spring up from the earthier base notes of cedar, birch and sandalwood, drying down to a fresh, mysterious, powdery greenness.  A seamless blend of modern and organic, seething and subtle, CdG3 captures all that we love about these kind of dreams: pure, tangible possibility."," Basil, mandarin, black currant, magnolia, everlasting flower, angelica, Lebanese cedar, birch essence, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wonderwood Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," After several collaborative projects, Comme des GarÃ§ons launches a purely Comme des GarÃ§ons scent –“A positive overdose of woods, woody notes and synthetic wood constructions (Wood gone mad).” And it has.Wood, of course, has been part of the Comme des GarÃ§ons Parfums DNA from the outset, and here perfumer Antoine Lie has pulled out all the stops: this is all wood, just like it says on the bottle, the notes melding through the common smokiness of incense, guaiac, sandalwood, vetiver and oud with a hint of musty patchouli, dried out by cypress and cedar, wrapped in the powdery, velvety muskiness of Cashmeran. This sensuous ode to woodiness, translated into an eerie gorgeous visual rhapsody by the Quay Brothers, may just be the most quintessentially CdG fragrance since its first, groundbreaking offering by Mark Buxton in 1994, Comme des GarÃ§ons Eau de Parfum. It is wood made liquid and smoke and take our word, like the man“who loved woods more than any words could say” in the video, you'll want to drown in it.

Amazingreen Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," In an interview to a French magazine, the perfumer Jean-Christophe HÃ©rault admitted to a twin obsession with the sap-filled scent of lentiscus and the smell of freshly renovated old houses. Somehow this blend of green and mineral must have inspired Amazingreen. Or did he take his cue from the flint and smoke facets of vetiver?This“blast of green energy” from Comme des GarÃ§ons starts out cool as a tropical shower from bouncing shiny leaves the size of umbrellas. Moves on to a slightly sulfurous“gunpowder accord” (think of how the air smells after fireworks) as guerillas skulk through the undergrowth. Is that something burning? The ice-cold sear of green pepper on the tongue, the wisps of smoke of a campfire in a secret clearing...Tough and lush, exuberant but slightly dangerous, the vegetal and mineral elements unfurl their various facets side by side.

Black Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons," Black is many things. One of those things is a positive number on a balance sheet, the opposite of red. That may be the thinking behind BLACK, Comme des GarÃ§ons' fragrance started in 2009“In response to the general negativity engendered by the recession and to counter the feeling of things being blocked or stopped because of the crisis.”œFour years later, the brand marks the concepts anniversary through the launch of BLACK Eau de Toilette, an emergency, guerrilla-like, spiced-up new scent, which Rei Kawakubo, never one to shy away from literalism, has infused with Madagascar black pepper and Somalian incense, with essences of leather, licorice, birch tar and pepperwood. The result? A swoon-inducing trip into the smokey, spiritual world of incense, touched by the solar warmth of pepper and cedar wood. The licorice note adds a touch of cleansing 'eternalness' and, at times, feels uplifting. And in the end, we're left in a dizzying spell of delight. Dark and mysterious, yet ultimately calm and reassuring."," Cedarwood, vetiver, leather, liquorice, birch tar, pepperwood, black pepper, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Serpentine Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"“The Grass, The Trees, The Lake, And You”... The British artist Tracey Emin scrawled the words on the bottle. She also draw a couple embracing for the box, based on a sculpture she bought in Paris for her 50th birthday.The scent was designed by Christian Astuguevieille with Ã‰milie Coppermann on the occasion of the Serpentine Galleries' expanded presence in the Royal Park of Kensington Gardens with the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. And of course, this being Comme des GarÃ§ons, it conjures not only the bucolic fragrances of Hyde Park (that's the“grass, trees and lake” part) but a hefty whiff of London. What other brand would be loony enough to claim asphalt and“a little bit of pollution” in its notes list? As unabashedly avant-garde as the venue it was created for, Serpentine's depiction of“Nature in the City” joins the groundbreaking Odeurs (53 and 71) and the cult Synthetics series in celebrating the evocative powers and bracing beauty of urban smells.

Floriental Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," Even if you were unfamiliar with the term, you'd know a 'floriental' when you smelled it- this fragrance family combining floral notes with the dark woods, spices and resins that distinguish orientals are so popular as to be nearly ubiquitous. But with Comme des GarÃ§ons, there's always a twist, and so Floriental, the newest fragrance from the avant garde Japanese/French fashion stalwart, has chosen as its floral of note the Cistus flower- a flower without a scent. And so, CDG's Floriental is a postmodern floral, one where the sweet, lush, peppery aspects of flowers are created from plum, pink pepper, and sandalwood, and where labdanum- the rich resin that's the true fragrant bounty of the cistus bush- forms the basis of the oriental notes for a floral oriental both innovative and yet true in spirit. And in the modern, mischievous style of Comme des GarÃ§ons, Floriental is even nontraditional in structure- without classically defined top, heart and base notes, the fragrance evolves in unpredictable waves, trading off between lush fruitiness, resinous woods and fiery spice with delightful frequency, resulting in a scent that wears differently each time. At once layered and unstructured, simple and modern, masculine and feminine, Floriental is a landscape of wonderful contradiction, with a single exception- it's 100% CDG."," Pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dot Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons," The deceptive simplicity and industrial whimsy that define the Comme des GarÃ§ons aesthetic has always proven to be a remarkably versatile template for all types of fragrances. Dot, the newest release from the venerable house, demonstrates this with great aplomb: a fresh, fruity floral with wonderfully unique touches of resin and green notes, Dot is both lusciously feminine, but also distinctly CDG. Inspired not only by the smell of the Osmanthus flower but equally by the mysterious allure of a park filled with Osmanthus trees in bloom, Dot is more tone-poem than standard soliflore. The scent radiates with floral smoothness, but also with the fruity tonalities that emanates from the blossoms, the radiant green notes that illustrate the leaves, and white ambery woods that reflect the bark of the tree. Resinous olibanum gives the distinct character of a park set within a bustling cityscape, and pepper oil further enhances the balsamic, spicy aspect of the incense. The result is just as pretty as one could hope for, but with the distinctive character of another wonderfully modern Comme des GarÃ§ons creation. Like the titular white dots on the eye-catching flacon, Dot is sure to make you stand out from the crowd."," Osmanthus, fruits, green notes, amberwood, olibanum, pepper, bitter orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21644.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grace by Grace Coddington Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"“I've always loved the smell of roses and the first fragrance I ever wore was rose water. Over time, I've experimented with everyone else's version of Rose, and even got sidetracked by some others along the way. Now I've arrived back at the point I first started, with Rose. Except this time, it's my Rose.” – Grace CoddingtonAnd what a rose Grace has brought us. Fiesty and flirty, but with a dash of elegance, Grace by Grace Coddington opens with a wondrously fresh, delicately edgy opening of citrus and aromatics, all the while anchored by a youthful but deep rose supported with fruity depth. Vetiver and smooth, musky woods lend character and strength, but this is rose's party, and the lush, fresh, sexy florals are front-and-center to the very last compelling sniff. An icon like Grace deserves no less.Housed in a wonderfully feline-inspired bottle to celebrate Grace's lifelong love of cats."," Bergamot, mint, basil, cardamom, pink peppercorn, rose, freesia, peach blossom, vetiver, cashmere woods, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21645.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muskane Demi Extrait,Nishane," Between light and dark, innocent and wicked, and EDP and extrait, lies Nishane's new Icons Collection- striking, seductive new scents presented in a ""demi extrait"" concentration and based around a central component. Muskane, as the name might suggest, is a musk lovers paradise- an indulgently powdery, smoothly floral, gently gourmand cloud of muskiness that confidently struts the line between divine purity and carnal sin. Gently sweet, piquant raspberry infuses a low hum of energy into the delicate yet lush rose and powdered violet of the floral body, which in turn amplifies the overwhelming and delightful cascade of soft, sexy, lightly creamy musk, topped with a dollop of ambered vanilla.Smooth and seductive, pillowy and powdery, Muskane is enough to make you weak in the knees."," Raspberry, rose, violet, amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Florane Demi Extrait,Nishane," Between light and dark, innocent and wicked, and EDP and extrait, lies Nishane's new Icons Collection- striking, seductive new scents presented in a ""demi extrait"" concentration and based around a central component. Florane is, you guessed it, a floral scent, with a powerful and complex heart of violet, muguet (lily of the valley), and jasmine, but if you're picturing a demure, powdered white floral, think again- kissed with bright, juicy fruit and sweetened with warm, ambered woods, Florane is a vivid, vibrant, unforgettably sexy floral rich with delightfully unexpected combinations. An opening of beautifully tart grapefruit and aromatic cassis set the stage for the aforementioned floral heart, which feels neither overly vintage nor simplistically youthful- rather, it's a sexy, modern, three-dimensional bouquet that grows more dynamic still with the warm, woodsy base of amber, hinoki, musk, and the perfect touch of sweet vanilla. The result is a striking, long-lasting, and complex floral that can transition from sweatpants to soirees and back again without breaking stride. In other words, just the kind of versatile, creative, and compelling stunner we've come to expect from every new Nishane release."," Grapefruit, cassis, violet, muguet, jasmine, amber, hinoki, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lustre Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," Imagine the sun rising over seemingly endless fields of roses in the heartland of Bulgaria. Lovers of rose know that given the infinite complexity inherent to the flower, a true rose soliflore may be anything except predictably simple. It is in this wondrous spirit that Hiram Green delivers Lustre, a celebration of the exquisite Bulgarian rose that combines everything we love about rose with everything we love about Hiram Green. To put it another way, Lustre is a vivacious, joyful, sun-drenched rose scent with an abundance of both naturalism and sophistication. This is unmistakably Bulgarian rose, so lush and fresh that you can feel the soft flesh of pink petals between your fingers, with citrus to maximize its sparkling brightness, creamy orris to round out the lush floral profile, and just a dab of olibanum for richness and longevity and to complement the rose's natural honeyed sweetness. A near perfect Bulgarian rose soliflore, Lustre is a new triumph for one of niche perfume's most meteoric rising stars."," Bulgarian rose, citrus, orris, olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau de Reims,Reims Parfums," L'Eau de Reims smells very French. Primarily an essay on the fresh, celery-like greenness of petitgrain and neroli, Duchaufour twists things in a slightly chyprÃ© direction with a generous lick of salty, dark green oakmoss. Even more delightfully, proceedings open here with a volley of bitter, lemony eau de cologne-style notes that last just long enough to jolt its wearer awake. The real star of L'Eau de Reims, however, is that remarkable petitgrain-neroli accord. Although neroli is not listed, we're sure we smell its modulating influence here, softening the lemony sharpness of the petitgrain with its characteristic soapy freshness and its lingering vegetal notes. A hint of geranium emphasizes the spicy, leafy greenness of the neroli. Oakmoss provides structure to the drydown, supporting the freshness of the petitgrain-neroli heart with a robust, salty minerality that never strays into dankness. We think L'Eau de Reims is a real tour de force for summer wear – as fresh and clean as a traditional eau de cologne, yet with the salty heft of a properly French chypre base. A new classic in the making? We think so."," Petitgrain, neroli, incense, geranium, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Haute Provence Eau de Cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," While wild lavender abounds throughout the countryside of Provence,  master perfumers know that ""true lavender, "" that which only grows at an altitude above 1200 meters,  has no substitute- boasting both fresher,  more camphorous tones and a sweeter,  richer,  warmer tone as it dries,  it's a superior material in every way to its common counterpart. So it's no surprise that Mme. Patricia de Nicolai,  perhaps the greatest living inheritor of the grand legacy of vintage French perfumery,  accepts nothing less than Haute Provence lavender in her fragrances,  and believes in its value as an ingredient so much that she presents it here,  with minimal embellishment,  as an eau de cologne- and the results are impressive. If anything,  the openness of an EDC lets the star ingredient shine,  delivering intensely sharp,  bright freshness up top,  complemented with spicy,  citric petitgrain,  and then drying to a smooth,  creamy iris-paired musky woodsiness that lingers with just the right amount of unassuming confidence on the skin. A classic eau de cologne is a vivid,  fresh sensory experience meant to strip away the levels of artifice between fragrance and nature. By those standards,  Haute Provence is an unmistakable gem."," Petitgrain, bergamot, lavender, iris, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31359.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hossegor Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," ""You walk through woods wet with spray and alive. Your fingertips, the tendrils of a fern, reach into the deep foliage, dissolve into the infinite. Why do you travel to where the sun shakes your hand? What good is devotion if it cannot combine body, land, sea, sky into equal parts loneliness and love? Lie down and rest here. And be made whole.""This is the pitch behind Hossegor, one of the most original and compelling oceanic scents we've experienced in quite some time. Inspired by the resort town deep in the south of France, an unforgettable pairing of beachside surfer's paradise and a lush marine lake, Hossegor the scent delivers a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing combination of mineral, herbaceous, woodsy, and aromatic notes that tap into a near-primal sense of sublimity. From a compellingly spicy, green, and herbaceous opening of fiery black pepper and resinous mastic to a rich aromatic heart of sage and oceanic sea salt, every note feels powerful yet balanced, naturalistic yet stylish, and glowing with the tempered warmth of the glowing sun setting over the rapidly cooling, tree-lined lakeside. A Lab On Fire has chased the sun everywhere from Ipanema to the South Pacific, but with Hossegor, they may have found their best destination yet."," Juniper, mastic, black pepper, sea salt, clary sage, orris root, olibanum, solar accord, ambergris, vetiver, mineral musks, wet woods, ambrox, sea moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ani Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," An ancient metropolis now abandoned to the ages, Ani and its many ruined churches now stand as a monument to the both the majesty of empire and the inevitability of time. To honor this mystical place and capture its unique evolution, Nishane has created a fragrance that juxtaposes bright freshness, fiery spice, rugged woods, and rich warmth- a true voyage through the ages. Ani opens with a bright, bracingly fresh and green bergamot- overflowing with juicy citrus and the snap of fresh vegetation, evoking the overgrowth that has retaken the crumbled walls. A blazing wash of gingery spice suggests the life that still remains, while a gorgeous, fruity rose peeks from between ancient stone. We feel the power of history, now, as rich, creamy, resinous vanilla and rich, earthy wood echo with multitude of voices now left to history. Complex, robust, and vibrant, Ani is a fragrance with true heritage to its name."," Bergamot, green notes, blue ginger, pink pepper, blackcurrant, Turkish rose, cardamom, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, benzoin, ambergris, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unutamam Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," As the first entry in Nishane's bold new ""Experimental Collection, "" Unutamam was bound to defy easy categorization. But that turns out to be the point: as conceived by Nishane and star fragrance blogger and creator Miguel Matos,  Unutamam (the name of a famous Turkish song) intentionally straddles the line between lush seduction and animalic ferocity,  leaving it to the wearer to decide which mood to allow the scent to embody. Unutamam,  from first spray,  is an intense experience: a whip's lash of lacerating aromatics and florals,  defying any attempt at a complacent reaction. Even as the florals grow smoother and lusher,  a smoky,  industrial undertone grows,  with patchouli,  labdanum,  and castoreum approximating the animalic thrum of petroleum,  the rough protection of military-grade leather. Or perhaps your journey into this intriguing and dynamic fragrance takes you in the other direction,  to a garden of herbaceous delight and sweet,  smooth caramelized amber. After all,  the choice is entirely yours- and what an accomplishment that is."," lavender, rosemary, mint, juniper, jasmine, carnation, patchouli, amber, oregano, castoreum, cistus, oakmoss, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milano Cento For Him Eau de Toilette,Milano Cento," A bona fide 1980's cult classic, Milano Cento was born in an era of cultural futurism and modernist design, but with an eye towards the classics. Now, nearly 40 years later, it's never been more compelling. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, Milano Cento Him opens with zesty, sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart. Sophisticated and stylish, this blend of vintage flair and modern energy is designed to keep the past alive while stepping boldly into the future."," Lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, lavender, rosemary, basil, clary sage, sandalwood, patchouli, clove, cinnamon, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/823000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Douce Amere Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Devilishly bitter, then divinely sweet – this eccentric brew is a bundle of contradictions from the moment it touches your skin. The absinthe is cool and the cinnamon is hot. The flowers are ethereal and the wood is strong. The licorice is sharp and the powder is soft and it all melds together in an indescribable way that will having you sneaking off to sniff your arm again and again. Moody and contrary, this is the unexpected lightness of heart at the sight of a gray, rainy day; the decadent thrill of reveling in a bad mood overlong; the sharp stab of melancholy when you hear of someone else being happy. This is dark and troubled and enigmatic, even through the sweetest parts, and at the heart of it all is the aromatic Artemisia absinthum, almost medicinal at first but becoming a warm and glowing narcotic presence as the elixir develops. Edgy and fiendishly attractive, this is the perfect scent to wear when you are looking for trouble. Actually, if you wear it, trouble will probably find you first."," Absinthe (Artemisia absinthum) , cinnamon, anise, lily, jasmine, tiare, tagette, marigold, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahat Loukhoum Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in Rome. If you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. It's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.And so it is with Rahat Loukoum. The sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. The base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible. Rahat Loukoum is that rare scent is that is far from your average gourmand-- though with Serge Lutens' pedigree, we're guessing you already knew that. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Aldehydes, almond, cherry, hawthorn, rose, heliotrope, white honey, vanilla, tonka bean, balsam, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36157.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Silver Mist Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," More iris, more, more, more, Serge Lutens famously urged Maurice Roucel when he was composing Iris Silver Mist. Legend has it that poor Maurice went back to the lab and, in his desperation, threw every known iris material into the formula, including a little-used iris nitrile called Irival. What emerged chrysalis-like from this chaotic lab experiment was a wonder of nature and a work of art.Iris Silver Mist smells entirely like a root freshly torn from the ground, caked with earth, dew, and ice. Its purity is lung-filling and green - as bracing as cold water running in a brook. Between the iced, milky roots of the topnotes and the cool musk in the base, clove and benzoin lend the texture a spicy, dusty feel that almost approaches human warmth. But make no mistake – Iris Silver Mist is as brutally pure as a block of ice melting slowly in a forest on the Russian Steppes. As close to wearing a piece of art as you're likely to get. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Orris root, galbanum, sandalwood, cedar, clove, vetiver, musk, benzoin, incense, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36158.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Et Musc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Ahh, Bois et Musc! We have a particular fondness for this unfairly overlooked gem in the Lutens Bois series, which wears like a sunset in smudgy golds and pinks. Bois et Musc is a soft, rosy cedarwood diffused out into a cloud of musk and sweetened with a judicious touch of spice (the notes say saffron, but we also smell a gentle nutmeg, cinnamon, and perhaps even a smattering of cumin). Far woodier and less syrupy-fruity than its siblings in the Bois series – Bois de Violette and Bois et Fruits – Bois et Muscs may actually be closer in spirit to the original Shiseido FeminitÃ© du Bois than the current Serge Lutens version.           More than scent, however, Bois et Musc is all about texture: its musk is velvety and beeswaxy, while its cedarwood is silky. Not as dirty as Muscs Khoublai Khan but not nearly as clean as Clair de Musc, Bois et Musc is, for us, the happy medium of Lutensian musks. It is sensual as hell but in that comfortably discreet way that makes people wonder if you're wearing perfume or just smell particularly good. And when you're wearing Bois et Musc, you most certainly do. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Atlas cedarwood, beeswax, saffron, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36167.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sarrasins Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Rich yet airy and ”˜clear', Sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to La Nuit's dense buttercream satin. Famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. Though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. Sarrasins is very elegant and very French - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. In the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. The dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. Beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. Sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication. Wear Sarrasins to feel inimitably French.  Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," bergamot, labdanum, carnation, osmanthus, jasmine, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36168.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanilla Vibes Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Everyone loves a vanilla scent. Playful, romantic, mouthwatering, sensual- it's the smell both of first crushes and decadent delicacies. And now, thanks to a clever and creative new release from Juliette Has A Gun, it's the scent of sun-kissed skin and fresh, sexy, summertime bliss.Inspired by the joy and spectacle of a summer music festival, Vanilla Vibes is a bold yet blissful combination of sensual vanilla and invigorating sea salt. From the first spritz, we swear we can feel the energy and excitement, as the bracing oceanic rush of salty atmosphere intertwines with a sweet and creamy, yet youthful vanilla, along with a warm, sensuous sandalwood.  A hymn to adventure and freedom, Vanilla Vibes is more than just your new summer go-to: it's guaranteed to keep the good times rolling all year round."," Fleur de sel, vanilla absolute, orchid, sandalwood, tonka bean, brown musk, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40133.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Winter Palace Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A stunning fantasia of fiery resins and smooth tea, Winter Palace is a mythological vision of China where dragons soar and intrigue lurks behind every gate. We're swept away from the opening burst of rich, oily, tea-infused citrus- miles from both the salty freshness of a Mediterranean citrus scent or the sunny sweetness of a California one- balanced against robust, gently toasty matÃ©. The exotic richness only deepens from here, as the distinctive red tea heart, earthy and subtly tart, takes on richer, more resinous character with a cascade of balsamic woods, as awe-inspiring and powerful as the serpentine form of a Chinese dragon undulating along the hill-studded landscape like a Great Wall in motion. As a deep, warm, vanilla-rich amber emerges in the base, we feel the true power of the scent, compelling and unique, imbued with ancient sophistication but glowing with vibrant potency. If you yearn for the ultimate combination of bright and rich, power and refinement- discover Winter Palace today."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lemon, mate, gurjum balsam, amber wood, tolu, benzoin, labdanum, red tea, tonka, styrax, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Peaches Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," As delightfully refreshing as a sparkling bellini or a scoop of sorbet on a scorching summer's day, White Peaches is an enchantingly simple burst of joy. Constructed around the unique nature of white peaches, which are sweeter, more floral and less tart than their more common yellow counterparts, White Peaches serves up a delectably ripe peach note, juicy and cool on its own, but made positively thirst-quenching with the addition of an ""iced"" elderflower note, distinctively chilly and wonderfully fresh. A base of silver birch transposes its normally Christmas-y wintergreen aroma to this warm-weather cocktail, revealing another layer of revitalizing crispness. For anyone craving a luscious, authentic, non-syrupy peach note perfect for even the hottest of weather, White Peaches is a delicious delight."," White peach, narcissus, elderflower granita, silver birch",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sundazed Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Say hello to endless summer. Sundazed,  the newest scent from Byredo,  is an infectiously joyful blend of bright citrus,  sugared florals,  and a sparkling skin musk that fans of Blanche already know and love. It's a love letter to spontaneous daytrips and wholesome indulgences- the citrus is zesty,  mouthwatering,  and energetic,  the neroli heart rich,  romantic,  and made deliciously sweet with a sugared note of fresh-spun cotton candy. And it all dries down to a clean,  soft musk that glows for hours with the gentle warmth of sun-kissed skin after a long day of outdoor adventures. And when we say ""endless summer, "" that's exactly what we mean- since Sundazed is now part of Byredo's permanent collection,  you can experience this little slice of beachside bliss whenever you want. So whenever you need to change your mood- or keep the good times rolling- this is the one to reach for."," Mandarin, lemon, neroli, jasmine sambac, cotton candy, skin musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Minthe Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," Invented in 1882 with the release of Houbigant's Fougere Royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine European fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of Diptyque. But in case you haven't figured it out from the name, Eau de Minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss DNA of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. Not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. As a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, Eau de Minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. Vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, Eau de Minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats."," Mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Splendiris Eau de Parfum,Dusita," With the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? In the case of the truly magical newest release from Dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- Splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.Splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. As the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals Splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. A perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. In other words, Splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. While we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new Dusita release, Splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Of No Man's Land Hair Perfume,BYREDO," BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented. Rose of No Man's Land is centered around the delicate petals of a Turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. A radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity."," Pink pepper, Turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, Turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Malt Eau de Parfum,Akro," What happens when you cross a peaty Laphroaig whiskey with an aquatic? Malt. Sure, it's the answer to a question we don't remember asking, but we're so happy that such a thing actually exists. Opening with a gorgeously caramelized whiskey note that conjures up both the smokiness and the toffee-like depth of an aged whiskey from the highlands of Scotland, Malt quickly slips into a firmly mid-tone register: rich but light, with toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding it together. This deft lightness of touch is underscored by a minty, anisic tobacco-like note, which the notes say is seaweed. Certainly, this note gains in salt and crunch as time wears on, but while it is redolent of the sea, it less the sweet, melony undertone of Calone-driven aquatics, and more the naturally green, salty outdoorsy air blowing in off the North Sea. Wearing Malt feels like drinking a glass of peaty Scotch with friends at a beach bonfire on a cold October evening, the air infused with salt, heather, and good, old-fashioned bonhomie."," Whiskey, Rum, Leather, Seaweed, Patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Eau de Parfum,Akro," Oh man, this is good. A thick pour of molten dark chocolate to begin with, as strong and as intense as an espresso, but absent any of the metallic or animalic aspects that can sometimes emerge in dark chocolate. This is dark chocolate idealized. It's not sweet or creamy, but there's a strong hint of caramelized milk running underneath the rafters of the scent to pull it back from acridity. It's pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss.Throughout the day, as the dark chocolate tonality ebbs away, a gloriously rich, nutty base steps forward to fill the vacuum. Spicy, cinnamon-flecked tonka and hazelnut notes combine with vanilla to create a suede-textured drydown that seems to go on forever without shedding any of its richness – a thing of beauty in a world where oftentimes the ending is rushed. Interestingly, though from the same hand that created Angel, Dark is its complete opposite – plush but not fruity, and gourmand but not edible or ”˜yummy'. Dark is an exquisitely balanced, elegant chocolate quasi-gourmand that leans to the adult side of the indulgence spectrum. An utter pleasure to wear."," Cocoa, Dark Chocolate, Cinnamon, Hazelnut, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Night Eau de Parfum,Akro," Night will make you blush. A finger stroke's worth of cumin imbues an innocently rosy musk with enough inner thigh naughtiness to stop anyone in their track's, retrace their steps, and follow that divine scent to its source: you. Night is sexy because it dances on that barely perceptible line between clean and dirty, never tipping its hand too far in one direction or the other, and therefore keeping you guessing all the way through.Picture the aftermath of love – sheets tangled, traces of clean sweat and passionate kisses cooling quickly on the pillow. Your lover's gone, but everything still smells of them, including your skin and hair. Mingling with the scent of love is the fresh smell of the neroli and rose soap you both washed with that morning, and the starchy brightness of just-laundered sheets. The prismatic dance between clean and dirty, fresh and lived-in in Night is utterly entrancing; it feels sexy and alive and human."," Bulgarian Rose, Cumin, Saffron, Agaroud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Smoke Eau de Parfum,Akro," Smoking. The ultimate modern taboo. A dirty word. And yet, for those old enough to remember, there is something viscerally pleasing about the acrid aroma of a freshly-lit cigarette – perhaps because all the more attractive for its illicit, banned-in-public places, worse-than-marijuana notoriety it now enjoys. How AKRO Smoke smells to you will depend on your experience with smoking. For reformed smokers, it will smell nostalgic and haunting, a memory of coats, hair, and rooms impregnated with the acrid scent of cigarettes long stubbed out. For the uninitiated, it may smell almost shockingly intense, boasting a range of aromas from rubber and camphor to ash. A smidgen of sweetness from creamy tonka and powdery benzoin in the base is there for support, but in the end, there is nothing sweet or gourmand about this. Just a transparent, weightless wash of honest-to-goodness second hand cigarette smoke on the skin; sexy in a grimy, lived-in way that's difficult to explain to anyone who's never indulged. If you love Jeke by Slumberhouse, but want a summer-sheer version, then Smoke should be on your sample list."," Balkans Tobacco Leaves, Nicotine, Cade, Benjoin, Tonka Bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Haze Eau de Parfum,Akro," Haze is the aromatic fog of a Bohemian cafÃ©, where the lurid green fairy of absinthe mingles with the sage-bush dryness of an illicit spliff. But surprisingly, before it is all this, it is a whirlwind brush with a kitchen garden after a downpour, a riotous vortex of crushed mint, snapped plant stems, and the herbal dewiness of clary sage. It smells like fresh lavender buds and wet soil, a winning mixture of sun-warmed herbs and the cool dampness of a spring shower. Deeply herbal and green, Haze slowly starts to dry out to the bittersweet, grassy smokiness that will later define it as a creature of the night. A boozy artemisia note adds that anisic, Pernod-like twang that still, years after absinthe was made legal again, feels quite naughty. The impression of marijuana is there, but subtly so, and certainly not enough to get you pulled over by the police. A softly smoky leather accent in the base ties it all together – pulling the scent from bright, wet, sunlit kitchen herbs to poetry reading in a Parisian cafÃ© in one easy, fluid arc. Sexy in a casually-tousled way, Haze is for those who like fresh and aromatic, but done with an irreverent twist."," Absinthe, Armoise, Eucalyptus, Spearmint, Clary Sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 02 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Ambroxan is the ingredient around which Molecule 02 orbits around exclusively (sister scent Escentric 02 blends the note with others). Natural ambroxan is one of the lusted after components of ambergris, the prohibitively costly, rare excretion of a sperm whale.  To be absolutely honest, when we tried this, we were shocked by its subtlety...and we mean subtle.  In fact, all we can smell is a smooth, skin-like, we-can't-put-our-finger-on-it fragrance afterthought that might as well be our own skin...but it isn't. There is a slight mineral-like edge to it but it's transparent and mild...if you're the type of person who can instantly tell the taste of plain water versus a mineral water like Evian, you'll instantly pick up on the gentle nuances of  Molecule 02. To sum it up, Molecule 02 is very light yet always present and hovering about four inches above where you applied it, especially after a few hours. The term“skin scent” has never been more embodied than in this perfume and we bet it will both fascinate and confuse perfume lovers for a long time to come. If there's anyone in your life who“can't stand perfume”, you've just found a little bottle of perfection for them.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 02 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," While its sister scent Molecule 02 is built around the single note of ambroxan (the manmade equivalent of costly natural ambergris), Escentric 02 blends the note with vetiver and the cruelty-free musk imposter muscone. Add just a touch of orris, elderflower extract and the sunny, jasmine-like feel of hedione and it's light, refreshing and yes, even brisk fragrance that sparkles and enchants from beginning to end.  It's the kind of brisk you think of when smelling a freshly poured gin and tonic over lots and lots of ice, only Escentric has a fascinating mineral-like finish that amps things up to super spectacular. It's a wear  anytime, go anywhere type of scent with a very relaxed, unassuming nature...utterly at ease, totally uncomplicated and easy going, we find ourselves reaching for it over and over when everything else just seems not quite right that day.  This one's too rich for the office, that one's too citrusy today, I'm not in a patchouli mood...ahhh, here's the perfect one!  Escentric 02 fits the bill every time.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavender Extreme Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Fresh. Divergent. Stimulating.Tom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extreme. Lavender is reworked and refracted like is never has been before to become something irreverently new– a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume. Lavender is upended, translated from its storied origin in Provence and into a fresh subversion of itself. What We Think The normally relaxing scent of lavender gets a jolt of electricity in this intensely bright, invigoratingly modern fragrance with a sexy, spicy-warm tonka drydown."," Lemon, violet, lavender, geranium, rose, cinnamon, tonka Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Lavender Extreme by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Bana Banana Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The story of Bana Banana is, unlikely as this may seem, the story of the creation of L'Artisan Parfumeur. In the 1970's, chemist and plant collector Jean-Francois Laporte was planning to attend the legendarily exuberant and creative Les Folies Bergeres, and needed to up the ante for his latest look, which was, of course, a banana costume. Drawing on his knowledge of natural materials, he created a banana scent for himself, and in the process he discovered a heretofore unknown passion for fragrance made with traditional methods and exceptional raw materials, a calling that would eventually result in his founding of L'Artisan Parfumeur with the help of master perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena. Now, in collaboration with his daughter Celine Ellena, L'Artisan resurrects that legendary scent, reimagined with all the style, skill, and quality for which the brand has become famous. Oh, but did we mention how unbelievably fun it is? The banana is rich, green, and fruity, surrounded with lively pepper and savory nutmeg, the floral aspects reinforced with milky jasmine and gently powdered iris and violet to coax the impression of ripe banana skin. Warm, tonka-infused amber foregrounds the fruit, lingering like the heat of the sun at dusk. Playful yet sophisticated, and rich in both character and history, Bana Banana is more than just a banana scent- it's the legacy of L'Artisan Parfumeur in a bottle."," Pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Easy To Love Eau de Parfum,Eau d'Italie," One thing Italians love is an anniversary celebration. And so it's only fitting that the Eau d'Italie fragrance line, created 15 years ago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hotel Le Sireneuse Positano, has now begat a celebratory milestone of its own. Easy To Love, a love letter to fragrance, hospitality, and the stunning beauty of the Amalfi Coast, more than lives up to its name, wrapping us up in a lovely and soothing blend of fresh florals and juicy fig as seductive and timeless as Italy itself. It's a delightful example of quality over complication, with each note playing a vital role- white currant, sweeter than its better-known black and red siblings, still lends a distinctive tart buzz to the creamy, green fig note, made even fresher with a gentle peony. And lest we forget that la dolce vita is as much about sensory pleasures as it is the beauty of nature, Easy To Love features a luscious base of sweet honey, tonka bean, and subtly sensual ambrette musk- a nod to the food, drink, and romance one almost can't help but experience on the Mediterranean. If 15 years of Eau d'Italie resulted in a scent this carefree and wonderful, we can't wait to see what milestones we'll be celebrating next."," White currant, fig, white peony, honey, tonka, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43237.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cassili Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," At the intersection of desire and delicacy, Cassili is a fruity-floral beauty that reminds us that Parfums de Marly does feminine scents with every bit as much modern-meets-classic complexity as their much-heralded masculines. Exploding with triumphant fruitiness, yet anchored by a sophisticated woodsy gourmand base, Cassili is both fashion-forward and refined, with a true Parfums de Marly signature. From the first spray, Cassili leaps off the skin with joyful abandon, featuring mouthwatering notes of plum and redcurrant set against lushly textured florals- romantic rose, fresh mimosa and peachy plumeria, a delightful bouquet with enough sweetness to swoon over, but also enough floral firepower to seduce. As the complexly gourmand drydown- a creamy blend of vanilla and sandalwood- develops, we find ourselves completely under its spell. Fresh and sweet, classic and modern, fun and sexy- Cassili is a scent for women who don't need to compromise."," Red currant, rose, white flowers, plum, mimosa, plumeria, petalia, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ganymede Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois," Ganymede, the rocky satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. In collaboration with Quentin Bisch, Marc-Antoine Barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.Ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, B683, an instant classic. This time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. Mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. A galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, Ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. What We Think A saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in B683- airy but still substantial."," Mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, Immortelle absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 1 Tonic Blanc Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," As fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot Sunday morning. No. 1 Tonic Blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. The neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. It's a slap in the face of heat.As the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. Yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. The sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. This one's easy – a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat. Fantastic on both women and men."," bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 2 Seve Nouvelle Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," SÃ¨ve Nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. With its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. A playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that Wella Balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-Granny Smith apple. This peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. SÃ¨ve Nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. While this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives SÃ¨ve Nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once."," grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 3 Crepuscule Ardent Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," CrÃ©puscule Ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. Echoes of a sweet Tuscan Leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. The intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. CrÃ©puscule Ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an Arabian style amber settles in towards the base. Nothing sweet or syrupy, however – here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. This is the scent that a Valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light."," saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 4 Apres l'Amour Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," AprÃ¨s l'Amour is a 1960's Serge Gainsbourg song filtered through the synth pop sensibilities of the 1980's: candied lemon-rind musks and animalic notes suspended in a haze of modern woody-ambery aromachemicals. It smells like human skin after lovemaking – erotically charged, moist, musky – but thanks to a mesh of powerfully dry, smoky woods and electric ambers, broadcast at high volume to the rest of the world. It's this constant shifting of the scent from intimate to radiant and back to intimate again that makes AprÃ¨s l'Amour work. It seems to come with its own atmosphere - a crackle of electricity in the air; the rumbling of a storm to come. Utterly modern, even a bit brash, it's one of those my-skin-but-better fragrances that send out a subliminal message of attractiveness without you really knowing why or how. If you like scents such as Molecule 01 and Another 13, make sure you don't miss out on AprÃ¨s l'Amour."," bitter orange, lemon zest, aromatic notes, fresh spice, dry wood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 5 Frenesie Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," While most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, FrÃ©nÃ©sie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. Cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. Dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, Japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. The soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. If we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. Either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. A fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. Lovely, and quite innocent-smelling."," saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 6 Brume Radieuse Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Brume Radieuse proves that Thomas Kosmala has a particular sleight of hand when it comes to creating oud fragrances that depart from the norm. If FrÃ©nÃ©sie is a bon-bon of oud seen through a misty haze of jammy osmanthus, then Brume Radieuse is its equally floral, but grown-up sister, full of a simmering sensuality that makes you sit up straight in your chair. A bruise of blackcurrant juice – thick and tannic – stains the opening a deep purplish black and sets up a sexy fruity-rose beat that carries on throughout. At the heart, a nugget of salty black truffle – this would be the oud – is flanked on all sides by a chorus of juicy peach and coconut notes, the combination of which bears some resemblance to the mouthwatering aquatic-black chocolate accord that underpins Tom Ford's Black Orchid. A veritable riot of fruit, flowers, coconut, peach, and salty-earthy notes, Brume Radieuse shouldn't really work, and yet does. This is one sexy, feminine fruity-floral oud bomb that will not go without notice. The equivalent of that special black dress you wear like a weapon."," blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 7 Le Sel de la Terre Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Le Sel de la Terre is proof that Leonardo da Vinci's assertion that“simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” is correct. Infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. If it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that Kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. The musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. Le Sel de la Terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in Monsieur Balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. A salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of Calone or Ambroxan. Fantastic. We know what we're drenching ourselves this summer."," bergamot, Italian lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 8 Tonic Vert Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Tonic Vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. With its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. Unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. Rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. Yet this is not a classic green scent like No. 19 or even Green Irish Tweed – Tonic Vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. Though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. The combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 9 Bukhoor Elixir de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Bukhoor, or bakhoor as it is sometimes known, is the Arabic name for woodchips that have been soaked in precious essential oils, mixed with shards of frankincense and other resins, and finally pressed into soft, brownish bricks to be smoked slowly over an incense burner. All over the Middle East, bukhoor is burned generously to banish domestic smells of cooking and to make the home smell warm and welcoming to visitors. Bukhoor, Thomas Kosmala's take on the theme, honors its source material by being rich, smoky, and pugnacious, with an Arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic. The animalic bite of aged Hindi oud hits the nose first, its characteristic aroma of raw leather, and slightly dirty hay burning a blaze across the olfactory landscape. The scent mellows considerably in the base, where it takes a turn for dry and smoky, a smoldering woods note infusing the atmosphere with the marvelous scent of burnt paper, benzoin, and brown sugar. A bold, no-holds-barred take on an ancient material, and one that proves Kosmala's skill in handling it."," woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beaute du Diable Eau de Parfum,Liquides Imaginaires," ""Would you be willing to sell your soul to the Devil to possess his perfume? This essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction."" So reads Liquides Imaginaires' tagline for Beaute du Diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. Picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep. You're nervous, but intrigued, and as soon as their scent hits your nose, you know that for tonight, at least, you're going to go wherever they want you to go. That's the seductive, mysterious power of Beaute du Diable."," Lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Monarch Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Plenty of fragrances are powerful or complex, but what makes a scent truly regal? In the case of Oud Monarch, the answer is power and complexity in the service of pure, indulgent, delightful comfort. Just as Areej Le Dore's Oud Luwak gave us the why-didn't-we-think-of-that savory voluptuousness of oud and coffee, so too does Oud Monarch delve deep into gourmand territory, delivering a richly mouthwatering cocoa-infused oud scent as luxuriously smooth as the finest royal vestments. While the oud on display is as precious and potent as in any scent we carry (as with all Bortnikoff ouds, it features frequent collaborator Russian Adam's treasured and rare ""Feel Oud""), the introduction of a rich cacao note does a miraculous thing, smoothing the animalic roar of the oud into a smooth and delicious purr that still resonates with power. It's so blissfully intense that it truly takes a moment for your nose to adjust, at which point you can appreciate the masterful attention to detail behind the potency- smooth, sweet florals, spiced tobacco and resin- all perfectly pitched to keep every sniff unique and intriguing. Oud lovers, chocolate fanatics, come together: here is a fragrance fit for a Monarch."," Magnolia, Frangipani, Rose de Mai, Himalayan Rose, Cinnamon, Tobacco, Oud Merauke, Oud co Chang (Feel-oud), Cacao, Civet, Castoreum, Labdanum, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff," What makes Bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. Take Amber Cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. It's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. Flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. Perhaps the easiest-to-wear Bortnikoff yet, Amber Cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality."," Bergamot, Lemon, White and Pink Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Cardamom, Frangipani, Jasmine Sambac, Virginia Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Grey and Brown Ambergris, Oud from Sri Lanka, Bouya Oud, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Khabib Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Musk Khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. Sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. But we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. It's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. Lovers of Areej Le Dore's Russian Musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again. Don't miss it."," Bergamot, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Ylang-Ylang, Cedarwood, Tolu Balsam, Ambergris, Deer Musk, Oakmoss, Vetiver, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sensual Instinct Eau de Parfum,Montale," Lush, sweet, and deeply intoxicating, Sensual Instinct is a journey through a kaleidoscopic fantasyland where mouthwatering fruit, romantic florals, and rich gourmand notes intertwine with uncontrollable abandon. A must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. Every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey. As the ambered, lushly drawn florals of the heart notes swell, so too does a delectable tiramisu accord, all set against a rich, gently earthy patchouli. And as the gourmand base of coffee, cacao, and vanilla intensifies, so too does the seductive power of this unforgettable scent. Lose yourself in the delicious haze of Sensual Instinct- your body knows what to do."," Bergamot, mandarin, cardamom, saffron, whisky, amberwood, jasmine, rose, tiramisu, patchouli leaves, cacao, coffee, vanilla, oakmoss, cedarwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale," With so much attention paid to Montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello Red Vetiver!). And so it is with great pleasure that we introduce Vetiver Patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. From the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. While we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, Fresh Montale. We've missed you."," Bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Dream Eau de Parfum,Montale," When one thinks of a Montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. And while those are wonderful, Oud Dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. The key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. Even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of Roses Musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. Don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of Montale's other oud scents. But once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when Oud Dream has its chance to shine."," Bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Holy Water Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," A rose-and-sandal attar in the body of a French eau de cologne. In the Middle East and India, some attars are composed specifically to protect the soul from djinns, or evil spirits. In the West, we use citrusy colognes to refresh the body in hot weather. Both concepts are rooted in the belief that certain materials in perfumery possess an excoriating, cleansing power to drive out bad spirits and bad smells. Abdes Salaam Attar's Holy Water (Aqua Santa) is a perfume  bridge between the Eastern concept of purifying one's soul and the Western concept of refreshing the physical. In pairing a bitter orange note with a dusty, ethereal frankincense, and placing it all in the context of a fresh eau de cologne, Holy Water emerges as a true hybrid between the Eastern and Western ”˜eaux de protection'. It's an almost medieval idea, but it works perfectly. A sweet, carefree orange blossom note gentles the piney austerity of the frankincense, softening what could have been an angular church incense into a hazy cloud of fruit, rose, and sandalwood. Although more fresh than sweet, Holy Water has a pleasing marshmallowy softness at its core that mitigates the impact of the tougher resinous and woody notes. It smells clean, vigorous, and above all, spiritually uplifting. Apply generously in times of sadness, melancholy, or simply when the greyness of the sky is wearing you down. Holy Water is a shot of sunshine delivered straight to your soul."," frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mecca Balsam Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Opening on a rich, smoky stew of incense over the crackle of dried tobacco leaf, Mecca Balsam sends the senses reeling, as if you'd suddenly stepped into the scent trail of a thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft as they circle the Black Stone in Mecca. Despite the tarry heft of the sticky balsams and resins, there is an airy sweetness to the underlying structure – a sort of smoked-out incense fairy dust – that elevates the scent and keeps it airborne. A common complaint leveled at incense scents is that they feel cold or severe, but there's no danger of that here. Dubrana has balanced the ancient salve-like feel of the incense with a musky, saline labdanum that reads like warm skin, in one stroke banishing any thought of High Church and drawing our mind instead to what he originally intended Mecca Balsam to reflect: the seething mass of human souls gathered around the Kaaba to perform the Hajj. Mecca Balsam is both sacred and divine, therefore, pitching the throat-catching aridity of incense against the warm, sweet embrace of flowers and amber. Unusual in that it simultaneously purifies and comforts, Mecca Balsam feels less like perfume than it does a statement of faith."," Indian tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milano Caffe Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Milan is a city that prides itself on the uncompromising purity of its espresso, and in Milano CaffÃ©, the roasted bitterness of the bean meets its match in a square of viciously dark chocolate. If you've ever sipped an espresso while nibbling on a bar of 80% cacao chocolate, then you'll be familiar with the dark, burnt edge that connects them on the Venn diagram of taste. Dubrana feeds it to us straight for a while – no sugar or milk – and it's so intense that little sips are in order. Earthy and bold, the scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like the steamy vapors in a Milanese coffee house. Slowly, the master eases up on the intensity of the coffee-cocoa double whammy, drip-feeding a powdery iris into the mix like a tip of the milk jug. This is followed closely by the mocha almond creamer of tonka bean. Now we move out of pure espresso territory and into the creamy, cocoa-sprinkled milkiness of a cappuccino. It's rich but definitely not sweet, a hint of fiery cinnamon in the opoponax lending a nubbin of spice that adds texture to the silken flow. A dash of incense additionally lends an interesting salt-n-pepper tartness that stops any gourmandise in its tracks. Still incredibly indulgent, Milano CaffÃ© is the tira-mi-su (meaning ”˜pick-me-up' in Italian) the adults in the room have been waiting for."," coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oakmoss Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Oakmoss (Quercia di Muschio) is deceptively named, because, despite the clear presence of oakmoss, this scent is far more about vetiver than moss. Still, the genius of the fragrance – for us – lies in the fact that Dominique Dubrana has obviously mined the areas of convergence between these two materials to emerge with a creature that has a foot in both worlds. Thus, the marine-like inkiness of the oakmoss connects with the rooty earthiness of vetiver via the crunch of sea salt and a shadowy ”˜forest floor' gloom. In the background, a dry, minimally smoky sandalwood provides a palette against which the notes of earth, grass, root, and lichen can really pop. Strangely, for a scent so heavily inspired by the elements of earth, grass, moss, and wood, Oakmoss is far more elegant and ”˜pulled together' than the kind of scent you'd throw on for a hike in the woods. In fact, its crisp, tailored lines make it a perfect candidate for formal office wear. But however you choose to use it, the fact remains that Oakmoss is a riveting distillation of everything rooty, wet, and green in the forest. We find it to be soul-restoring and exciting in equal measure."," vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 1 Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 1 was composed to provide the oud beginner with a primer on what the material actually smells like. To this end, the perfume amalgamates several key characteristics of different oud terroirs and blends them into a seamless whole to give the wearer an idea of the real deal, without compromising on wearability. In Oud Caravan No. 1, the camphoraceous, minty bite of a Borneo-style oud gives the opening a punchy freshness that contrasts delightfully with the animalistic warmth of the aged Indian oud that lies just beneath. Imagine a Bengali tiger and what he smells like: you sense the clean fur of the animal himself, but also the peppery heat of his breath and the dried-straw inkiness of his dung. Indian oud, especially the aged stuff, as used here, is the stuff of Kings - as noble as it is ferociously animalic. Spicy, masculine, and leathery are the three words we'd choose to describe this statement-making scent. Wear it to mark your territory."," natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 2 Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 2 was born out of the suggestions from Dubrana's testing group that No. 1 was simply too leathery, dry, and masculine to win over women. Dubrana listened carefully. After all, his avowed mission with Oud Caravan No. 1 had been to make The Ultimate Oud Fragrance that would sweep newcomers to oud oil, including women, off their feet and expose them to the glory of natural oud. Oud Caravan No. 2 handles the animalistic, barnyardy qualities of oud oil in a much lighter fashion, softening its leathery rudeness with an earthy vanilla and a subdued floral note, something creamy and pale like freshly-opened tuberose buds. The topnotes, similar to No. 1, open with a medicinal, stemmy freshness, which this time seems to come from tuberose rather than from Borneo oud. Although still unmistakably oudy, Oud Caravan No. 2 is an ethereal, dewy take on a famously gruff material – something that Arwen from Lord of The Rings might wear."," natural aged, wild Bengali oud oil, white flowers, Laotian oud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 3 Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 3 is the culmination of Dubrana's work on the Caravan series, and the version he feels best encapsulates his vision of a universally-pleasing oud scent. Removing the sharp camphoraceous topnotes that presaged both Caravan No. 1 and No. 2, Dubrana envelops the wild agarwood oil in a warm, fudgy date-like sweetness, using dried fruit and amber notes to subtly nudge the texture dial from leather to velvet. Rich and mellow, Oud Caravan No. 3 goes down smoothly, like a 50-year-old Scotch. Remarkably, Dubrana has steered the oudiness of this scent away from the jungly wetness of the first two scents and towards an airiness that feels like the windows being thrown open onto a closed-up room. As smoky as it is rich, Oud Caravan No. 3 is just animalic enough to remind you that you're wearing real oud, but smooth enough for you to enjoy it without the steep learning curve. As great for women as it is for men."," Natural aged wild Bengali oud oil, dates, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Chocolate Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Amber Chocolate is a lush gourmand amber that should come with a sticker that reads“for grown-ups only”. Put aside any thoughts you might have of the kind of yummy vanilla-and-berries smell surrounding young girls like a nuclear cloud – this is seriously dark and sexy stuff. A molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. The fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it's a guilt-free indulgence. Despite the almost comically simple name, Amber Chocolate is not a simple affair. There's a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny Cuban tobacco leaf. We think it's the real vanilla absolute that's been used in Amber Chocolate. Woody and resolutely non-sweet, it lends a boozy depth that reads in some lights as brandy or amaretto. Amber Chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes the golden sweetness of amber so effectively that even the amber-averse might be tempted. But honestly, if you ever loved or bought a bottle of Bruno Fazzolari's Ummagumma, Slumberhouse Ore, or Guerlain's Gourmand Coquin, then this boozy chocolate amber is 100% for you."," chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Hindu Kush takes its name and inspiration from the 500-mile mountain range running along the hinterlands of Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Pakistan, characterized by wild pine forests that give way to jagged mountain peaks. The scent mirrors the sensory contrast between forest and stone to perfection, capturing in particular the chilly isolation of rugged places unreachable to most humans. It is a meditative scent that taps into our need for silence and contemplation.  The contrasts in Hindu Kush are what drive the scent. In pairing the cool lemon-and-pine notes of pure frankincense with the fiery heat of ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, Hindu Kush achieves an incredible fire-and-ice character that captures our interest throughout. Resinous, mossy woods create the impression of oiled floorboards, a smell that is both comforting and nostalgic. The incense notes are smoky and balsamic, but the freshness of pine leaves drags the priest's censer out of the chapel and into the forest clearing. It's a scent of worship, yes, but here we're worshipping at the altar of Nature herself. Picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat over fires, surrounded by the howling ice winds of the Hindu Kush, and you get an idea of the mysterious alchemy between the culinary and the spiritual at play here. We can think of nothing quite like it."," spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aenotus Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," On a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of Aeolia, a mythic God tends to the divine winds. At a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient Europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction. This is the power of Aenotus, itself a fragrance of contrast: freshness and warmth, comfort and primal power. While Puredistance founder Jan Ewoud Vos has a personal connection to every scent, Aenotus was conceived to be his signature- a scent that had to be instantly refreshing, while also presenting a rich, long-lasting second phase more sophisticated than your average ""fresh"" scent. And with the help of master perfumer Antoine Lie, Aenotus delivers, wowing us with an eye-popping, euphoric burst of complex citrus and mint notes that smoothly flows into a warm, deeply sensual base of mossy skin musk that lingers on skin for hours and clothes for days. This rare achievement is possible via Puredistance's no-matter-the-cost philosophy, as Aenotus boasts an astounding, unprecedented 48% perfume oil concentration developed over three painstaking years. Was it worth it? Close your eyes, spray it on, and when your feet finally touch the ground again, decide for yourself."," Orange, mandarin, lemon, yuzu, mint, blackcurrant bud, petitgrain, oakmoss, patchouli, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tabac Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Tobacco fragrances often get the ”˜weight' thing wrong. Too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. Tabac by Abdes Salaam Attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. The tobacco leaf in Tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. Its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. As you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. But fear not! The resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. Tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. It's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. In a word – suave."," tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 03 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," As with the first two pairs, launched in 2006 and 2008, Schoen has designed two new scents as homages to a single scent ingredient, or aroma-chemical.  What Molecule 01 did for ISO E Super and Molecule 02 did for Ambroxan, Molecule 03 does for vetiveryle acetate.Ultimate is an overused word. Some bandy it about, announcing that something or other is the ultimate sports car, the ultimate cabernet, the ultimate restaurant. However, we can with confidence write that Molecule 03 is the ultimate vetiver. The aroma-chemical in Molecule 03 is vetiveryle acetate, a stark, clinical name for a vetiver note which is celebrated in its purest form in this fragrance. Amazingly, this single note runs the gamut of all aspects of vetiver.    Molecule 03 opens with a heady, sparkling brightness that develops into a rooty earthiness. As it melts into your skin, it contrasts with the slightly sweet and very green heart that is a hallmark of this perennial grass native to India. It has that yin and yang of cold and hot; it's a skin scent with a sly sillage.  Were it jewelry it would be a single, flawless emerald in a simple platinum setting, a thing of beauty and perhaps the most perfect vetiver you've ever experienced. Vetiver lovers: your ship has come in.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 03 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 03 is a tribute to the more familiar side of vetiver: its dark, slightly exotic woodiness. The fragrance opens with a burst of freshness – the ginger root is joined by top notes of green peppercorn and Mexican lime.The heart of orris is surrounded by Egyptian jasmine and soft tea notes. Then, at the base of the fragrance, the slightly bitter notes of vetiver are smoothed by rich amber shades of sandalwood, cedar, leather and musk.The overall impression is spicy but fresh with warm balsamic undertones, like a traditional chypre. It's sensuous without sweetness, which is a signature by perfumer Geza Schoen. And, because he also excels at unexpected associations, you may even detect a fugitive tang of ginger ale.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isle of Man Eau de Parfum,Frapin," You are invited to experience the exhilaration of life lived at 100mph, whipping down the wind-swept coastlines and tight mountain curves of the Isle of Man in all its famed race-week splendor.

In each breath, we feel the sparkle of sunlight in notes of grapefruit and bitter orange, while herbaceous, floral and salt notes brings the uniquely British beauty of the island into vivid contrast- fresh, wild basil, fields of wildflowers, and the bracing freshness of ocean air. It's the kind of wonderful, fully realized men's scent that's every bit as sexy on her- the only prerequisite is an untamed soul."," Grapefruit, bitter orange, basil, salt accord, freesia, violet, ironwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22619.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Elixir isn't your grandmother's Roja Dove scent- but we think even she'd agree you smell fabulous."," Bergamot, lily of the valley, geranium, rose de mai, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, violet, raspberry, peach, violet leaf, cinnamon, cedar, cashmere wood, sandalwood, vanilla, orris, cedar, ambrette, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Mauresque Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Each release of Serge Lutens' Palais-Royale exclusives into the export line is an eagerly awaited event and with this season's Cuir Mauresque, aficionados will, at last, be able to revel in the definitive Oriental leather, in the line of Caron's mythical Tabac Blond with spices added.This isn't the tough, rawhide pungency rising from Marrakech tanneries, but the smoothest, fatty-rich leather rubbed in flowers and a sweet spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and clove infused with the fragrant smoke of incense and myrrh rising from censers. Sweetened by orange blossom, mandarin peel and amber, Cuir Mauresque gives off a tawny, ember-like glow. The leather accord itself is produced by burnt styrax, a balsamic material with tarry, animalic facets; clove, incense and aloe wood add a dark, burnt edginess to the accord, while civet pulls it towards the animal.With its spiced dried fruit accord, resins and white flowers, Cuir Mauresque, originally launched in 1996, is perhaps the quintessential Lutens: the master himself has gone on record saying he doused himself in on the rare occasions when he goes out.  And considering the choice he's got, that's saying quite a lot. What We Think Spicy, powdery, and animalic, this is a delightfully sexy secret weapon of a fragrance."," amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chene Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," If you thought the oak, beeswax and rum notes would take you in Uncle Serge's secret Western-style den – the one with the polished heirloom furniture where he trades mint tea for a tipple – you'd be very much mistaken...  ChÃªne is quintessentially Lutens: dried fruit, spices and wood.In ChÃªne (French for oak), each note seems to mesh with the others to create a flammable mixture drenched in woody saps and resins... The fruity booziness of the oak, rum and immortelle segues, through the latter's tobacco and honey notes, into the beeswax and tonka bean. The smokiness of the tonka bean echoes that of the birch tar and oak. The bone-dry, pencil-shavings cedar is suffused with the aromatic camphor of the black thyme and the underlying bitterness of the oak tannins is nestled in an“undergrowth note” which chypre aficionados will recognize as... oak moss. In fact, ChÃªne is probably the closest Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake have come to composing an aromatic leather chypre, in their trademark oriental-style. What We Think Rich, woodsy, and delightfully long lasting, this is a masterpiece for any cedar lovers."," cedar crystals, wood sap, black thyme, oak, immortelle, beeswax, silver birch, rum absolute and tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36129.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fumerie Turque Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," An eagerly-awaited inclusion in the exports line (aren't they all?), Fumerie Turque evocatively weaves references to the honeyed tobaccos smoked in the seraglios of the Ottoman empire and the exotic cigarettes flaunted by the GarÃ§onnes in the gender-bending 1920s. It can't be too much of a stretch to envision Fumerie Turque as Serge Lutens' tribute to Caron's trailblazing Tabac Blond – albeit with his trademark Oriental twist.Smokey wisps of honeyed, fruity tobacco rise from a smooth, vanilla-flavored blend of tonka bean, styrax and Peru balsam, conjuring lazy winter afternoons smoking a hookah and nibbling rose-scented Turkish delights in a leather-paneled room. The rich, floral, faintly animal odor of beeswax rises from floors strewn with ornate rugs and polished daybeds. The scent of late-blooming jasmine wafts up from the palace gardens. Through the intricate wooden lace of a musharabieh, the Bosphorus glints in the sunset. Intoxicating and comforting, Fumerie Turque is the ultimate Orientalist reverie in a bottle. Succumb. What We Think Sweet, fresh pipe tobacco with surprisingly lush florals- a truly romantic unisex tobacco scent."," Corinthian raisins, white honey, candied Turkish rose, Egyptian jasmine, smoked leather, beeswax, Balkan tobacco, Peru Balsam, patchouli, tonka bean, styrax, juniper tar oil.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muscs Koublai Khan Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Musk, highly evocative of the most extraordinary scents imaginable; China, precious gold, opium dens. Refinement, cruelty... senses complex in their contradictions.KoublaÃ¯ KhÃ¤n, the Great Mongol ruler, Emperor of China. This Son of Heaven had a hill raised in the grounds of his palace, on top of which stood a lacquer and jade contemplation pavilion. The mound was planted with rare trees, kept green whatever the season. The ground was covered with glistening malachite and lapis lazuli particles... a coating of crystal. Muscs KoublaÃ¯ KhÃ¤n – a sensual, undulating aura. An animalesque scent. What We Think A cult classic of the animalic musk genre, MKK returns to Luckyscent with every bit of the rich, seductive growl it made its name with. Almost unbelievably sexy."," Vegetal Musk, Roots of Costus, Labdanum Rockrose, Grey Amber, Vanilla, Patchouli, Ambrette Seeds, pure Moroccan Rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36136.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tubereuse Criminelle Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," At last, Serge Lutens' mythical TubÃ©reuse Criminelle makes a break from the Palais Royal in this season's limited edition!Its surprisingly addictive minty-camphoraceous top notes are due to the Tiger Balm-ish smell of methyl salicylate, a molecule naturally present in the tuberose... Instead of taming their fierceness, Serge Lutens asked the perfumer Christopher Sheldrake to unleash it. But after this olfactory assault, the tuberose opens up its creamy heart, made richer still with its white floral sisters jasmine and orange blossom, contrasted with the green-rosy, indolic notes of hyacinth. A rich oriental base anchors it to the skin, the styrax underlining the almost leathery undertones of the tuberose, nutmeg and clove boosting its slow burn...Thus, the diva of the garden lives up to her reputation: first a slap, then a kiss... The rest, we'll leave entirely up to you. What We Think A dynamically minty take on tuberose for all the camphor lovers out there."," tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, hyacinth, nutmeg, clove, styrax, musk, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Serge Noire Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," A phoenix, the mythical bird of legend burns at the height of its splendour before emerging triumphant, reborn from the ashes in a choreography of flame, conjuring the shapes of yesterday in a dance of ashes. The swirls of oriental grey enrich the twilight with depth and intensity while windswept memories hint at the beauty of transformation.An ode to everlasting beauty under cover of night's rich plumage. What We Think This enchantingly spicy and dark stunner is perfect for men or women who love cinnamon and clove (both feature players here) but don't want to smell like dessert."," patchouli, cinnamon, amber and black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36122.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Louve Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," The newest Lutens creation, Louve, is the softest, gentlest, perhaps the most loveable of the entire line. It is a lunar scent, quiet and tranquil...tender like baby's breath, soft like the white fur of a mythical She-Wolf...The almond and rose petals accord, the center of the composition, is bound to satisfy the cravings of those who love loukhoum-inspired scents. Those who tend to avoid gourmand compositions because of their overwhelming sweetness, should, however, give Louve a serious try. This understated, only subtly sweet, sublimely elegant blend will change your mind. The slight powderiness of vanilla and amber, combined with the floral heart, gives Louve an enchantingly retro feel, making us think of expensive lipsticks of the days past, of the finest of face powders and of utter refinement. Chic and delicious...what more could you want from a fragrance! What We Think More fresh almond than most scents with the rose-almond-vanilla combination, this classic still feels romantic, youthful, and fun."," Almond, rose petals, fruity notes, jasmine petals, amber, musk and vanilla powder.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
De Profundis Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord! Inspired in part by Psalm 130, De Profundis is a love poem to resurrection, both of the soul and of nature. This fragrance opens on a thrilling note of new plant growth pushing rudely through wet soil, ripping its way into the weak sunshine. A haze of violets, chrysanthemums, muguet, and hyacinth chills the wearer like a dawn mist, creating a floral harmony so beautiful and so delicate that one is afraid it will collapse at any moment.It doesn't. The metallic, green, and watery aromas of emerging plant life are grounded by the earthier, velvety notes of soil and violet petals. The end result is a perfume that manages to suggest new life while remaining ever so slightly wistful and melancholic in tone. In the base, the ethereal florals are wreathed in smoke, incense, and earth, a reminder of our own eventual return to the ground.Serge Lutens' exclusive Palais Royal line is now available in a travel atomizer set that includes a metal case, two 30ml refills (for a total of 60ml of juice), and a funnel. What We Think A wonderfully fresh, bright, green floral- you can practically smell the dew on the chrysanthemum blooms."," Chrysanthemum, violets, green notes, earthy notes, ash, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36159.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 04 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Following on in the Escentric Molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the“meat” of a fragrance,  Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol,  a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen,  this could have been a disaster – Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is,  well,  too much. But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy,  creamy,  and steamy,  tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward,  and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light,  almost fresh,  with a green“stripped bark” note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness, ” says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree,  adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin,  giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30850.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 04 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to The Beautiful Mind series, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes – and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty“whiteness” that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer“my skin but better” scent for both men and women.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30851.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sorong Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the smooth, contemplative smoke of olibanum incense and the bright, luminous smoke of Indonesian kyara wood oud chips, Sorong is a grand vision of a mystical plane where the spiritual and supernatural collide. Centered around the ""animalized smoke"" accord created by this awe-inspiring combination- woody and spicy, with deep tones of amber- Sorong leads off with an energizing burst of citrus, spice, and blackcurrant, immediately elevating the fragrance with an airy yet substantial jolt of sophisticated energy and setting the stage for the vividly smoky, yet ultra-refined heart notes. Together, the potency of these materials is undeniable, and yet the effect is soothing, lending the wearer an aura of deep calm and protection. As it dries, a smouldering sexiness reasserts itself in the form of ambered musks which coax the animalism from the oud and incense with undeniable power. Like kyara itself, Sorong is a rare treasure, and a fragrance to savor."," Citrus, saffron, blackcurrant, kyara, olibanum, amber, animalic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34555.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chronic Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""In 1996, California became the first state in the US to legalize medical cannabis. But scratch the surface and there has always been a long history of cannabis cultivators and enthusiasts dedicating their lives to refining the herb. Chronic is a term for Cannabis and also alludes to 'The Chronic' - the debut album of Dr Dre. The Chronic was released in 1992, the same year as the Los Angeles riots."" -Johan BergerlinEye-openingly fresh, soothingly green, numbingly sticky- Chronic is everything a Cali weed scent should be. But rather than a straightforward reproduction of a bag of trees- after all, we can already get that out here- Chronic is a delightfully artistic reconstruction of the experience- from the sharply bitter citrus of the opening, to the dank green herbaceousness of clary sage, to a smokey twinge of vetiver. There's a naturalistic cannabis note in here too, but it emerges towards the end, bringing each note that preceded it together in a grand bouquet of, well, dankness. Take it from us- Chronic is the real stuff."," Petitgrain, bitter orange, bitter grapefruit, Russian clary sage, Virginian cedarwood, cannabis accord, amber, patchouli, vetiver, cashmere wood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Capri Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""I have always been captivated by legendary, trendsetting films. The movie Le MÃ©pris from 1963 featuring Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance is both iconic and stylish. The fragrance of Capri reflects the ambience of the movie. There are elements of wild citrus trees, orange blossoms, green olive groves, blue skies and the endless ocean that encircles the island."" -Johan BergelinInspired by the settings of Villa Malaparte and the iconic Godard film Le MÃ©pris, Capri is an eye-poppingly colorful journey. From the very first spray, Capri explodes with enchantingly bright aromas of blossoming orange trees, mandarin leaves and elements of the blue skies and endless ocean that encircle the island. Edgy but fresh, light but comforting, it's a stunning tribute to the rugged yet luxurious paradise on the Tyrrhenian Sea."," Mandora, Bitter Orange, Sweet Orange, Chamomile, Cardamom, Pink Pepper, Sichuan Pepper, Juniper Berries, Mandarine Oil, Mandarine Leaves Oil, Grapefruit, Galbanum, Jasmine, Osmanthus, Ylang Ylang, Orris, Ambroxan, Angelica Seeds, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chinese Tobacco Eau de Parfum,19-69,"“There are elements of different legendary movies like Indochine in the fragrance Chinese Tobacco. A reflection of East meets West taking place in the 30's to 50's colonial French Indochina. I'm often captured by these strong contrasts and different ambiances when travelling in Asia. The old and the new. A major influence for the scent was the powerful scene in the movie ”Apocalypse Now” featuring Aurore Clement and Martin Sheen smoking opium.” -Johan BergelinExotic, hypnotic, and more than a little dangerous, Chinese Tobacco is not your typically buttoned-up European tobacco scent. Fiery red pepper and coriander ignite the senses, while incense and oud add unexpected subtlety and a gently narcotic haze. Spicy and woodsy, primal and modern, Chinese Tobacco is a gripping study of East meets West."," Bergamot, Tobacco, Red Pepper, Lemon, Ginger, Coriander, Incense, Cedarwood, Vanilla, Tar, Oud, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kasbah Eau de Parfum,19-69,"“Stories of how personalities like Talitha and Paul Getty, Paul Bowles, Mick Jagger, Veruschka and Yves Saint Laurent all resided in Marrakech during the 60s and 70s have always inspired me. I'm intrigued by how they used this place for influences and escapes of all kinds: clothes, colours, music, interior and drugs. So, the fragrance of Kasbah is an appreciation to the international party scene during this era. ” -Johan BergelinWoody, welcoming, drenched in the soothing orange tones of a desert sunset, Kasbah is a hazy journey to the outer reaches of culture and consciousness. Opening with a sweet, zesty burst of citrus and honey, the shifting sands soon uncover dusty, warm geranium and delicately spiced amber. As the sun sets, casting an ever-more-auburn glow over clay walls, we smell the smooth, soothing combination of leather, tonka, and soft woods. It's a trip- in more ways than one."," Sweet Orange, Lime, White Honey, Geranium, Amber, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tonka Beans, Guaiac Wood, Leather Accord, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rainbow Bar Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""The notorious Rainbow Bar on Sunset Strip was founded when the word ""rainbow"" signified peace and freedom. Think Pamela Courson, sex, drugs and rockÂ´nÂ´roll. But there are also the other lighter dimensions like the sun, the blue skies and warm glow that embrace LA. As the lyrics in the famous song by America go: 'Driving on Ventura Highway, the free wind blowing through your hair.' It's all been captured in the fragrance Rainbow Bar.” -Johan BergelinLos Angeles during the glam rock era, in a wickedly smooth and spicy fragrance cocktail: that's the good-to-the-last-drop appeal of Rainbow Bar. A brightly bitter, herbaceous first taste of davana and wormwood goes down like a shot of Jager, while soothingly spicy cardamom, nutmeg, clove, and cypress keep the high alive. The woodsy base is rich, but soft, letting the spices sing all night long. With all the purring, shimmying sex appeal of feathered hair, eyeliner, and a leather jumpsuit, Rainbow Bar's got what it takes to keep the party rocking through last call."," Davana, Bergamot, Cypress, Wormwood, Cardamom, Marine accord, Basil, Elemi, Artemisia, Grape Seed, Bourbon, Nutmeg, Vetyver, Clove, Guaiac Wood, Cedarwood, Pimento Seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'air Barbes Eau de Parfum,19-69," ""I was in my teens when I first discovered Helmut NewtonÂ´s picture that made YSLÂ´s Le Smoking iconic. The genderlessness really made a big impression on me. With stark monochrome simplicity, Newton created a piece of iconography I still find myself influenced by. In the making of LÂ´air BarbÃ¨s I was strongly influenced by the androgyny in this picture."" -Johan BergelinCold and fresh, L'Air Barbes is a tribute to Paris, capital de la mode. Evocative of Paris' different personas such as the concrete alleyways, le banlieue and the area BarbÃ¨s-Rochechouart, the fragrance sings of chilled aldehydes, wet stone, and smooth, rich orris. Modern, yet timeless, just like the City of Lights itself."," Aldehydes, Fresh Lemon, Bergamot, Concrete, Ylang Ylang, Tuberose, Ambroxan, Orris, Cumin Seeds, Ink, Leather, Dry Woods, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gris Clair Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Gris Clair, Lutens's ode to lavender, evokes in our minds the image of a cool flame...a strange, otherworldly flame that illuminates but doesn't warm and doesn't burn if you touch it. The wonderfully refined, complex and beautifully ethereal creation beings with a chilly, shimmery, definitely“gray” lavender note. The contrast of the cold lavender and the sweeter, warmer blend of amber and tonka bean in the middle stage is incredibly appealing. Our favorite part of Gris Clair are the elegantly charred, smoky base notes of dry wood and“burned incense”. The darker accord gives Gris Clair an infinite depth and the exotic, opulent feel that we came to associate with the best Lutens's creations. The chilly lavender, the honeyed amber, the gently smoldering ashes of precious woods and incense create a unique, harmonious and striking, fusion of darkness and luminosity. Absolutely exquisite."," lavender, amber, tonka bean, iris, dry wood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleurs de Citronnier Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," The effect of beautiful simplicity is perhaps the hardest to achieve in perfume. Make it too straightforward and the scent becomes boring, complicate the composition, and the delicate beauty of the star notes becomes obscured. With Fleurs de Citronnier, Serge Lutens shows us how it's done, presenting the fragrance of classical simplicity, a harmonious, uncluttered blend which allows the radiant beauty of the ingredients to shine. Lemon blossom, neroli and tuberose form a delightfully pure and fresh accord, evocative of a breezy summer day...a romantic stroll in a Mediterranean garden, under the blossoming lemon and orange trees...A subtle musk note in the base grounds and rounds the scent, adding a sensual touch to the beautifully ethereal flowers. Treat yourself to a bottle of this breathtaking aroma and let it be forever summer."," Lemon blossom, neroli, tuberose, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme Aux Gants Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," A masterpiece of Italian Renaissance portraiture, Titien's Man With A Glove is renowned for the complexity of its subject, whose facial expression and hand placement suggest preoccupations far beyond the triviality of the idle rich. How appropriate, then, that L'Homme Aux Gants turns out to be a fragrance with a commensurate depth beneath the surface- a nuanced, sophisticated blend of oudh, spice, and woods designed for a gentleman who knows he's defined by more than the clothes he wears. L'Homme Aux Gants arrives on a wave of sweet, gently energetic Indonesian nutmeg, building into a warm, rugged heart of earthy cypriol and sensual hedione. But it's in the quietly powerful base that L'Homme Aux Gants truly comes to life, blending a soft, smooth oudh note with a rich melange of resins, woods, patchouli, and vanilla, creating a soothing yet complex aura that lingers for hours. Like the masterpiece that bears its name, L'Homme Aux Gants reserves its most treasured secrets for those with the sophistication to appreciate them."," Nutmeg, cypriol, hedione, oud, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, gurjum, tonka bean, benzoin, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bleu Satin Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by Thomas Gainsborough's famous The Blue Boy, Bleu Satin is a bright, fresh, exuberantly fruit-forward celebration of a scent, sure to appeal to lovers of fruity masculine scents everywhere. Impossibly juicy bergamot and electric green notes open the scent in full swing, while a deliciously fruity heart really separates Bleu Satin from its cohort, with sweet, intoxicating cassis and mouthwatering watermelon set against a hypnotically lush jasmine- fresh and elegant in equal measure. Finally, a base of gently-spiced leather lends longevity without sacrificing the vibrant spirit of the scent. Sophisticated and youthful, colorful and fresh, Bleu Satin is a new high-water mark for the fruity masculine, and we can't get enough."," Bergamot, lemon, green notes, jasmine, cassis, watermelon, saffron, leather, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36523.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Cavalier Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Gericault's Charging Chasseur, his first exhibited work, already demonstrated the artist's impressive talent for subverting the tropes of convention (in this case the heroic portrait of a Napoleonic cavalryman) in the service of creating a more complex, challenging narrative. It's the perfect inspiration for Cuir Cavalier, a richly spiced oud and leather scent that nods to the heavyweights of the smoky leather category while carving out a smooth, sophisticated niche all its own. Cuir Cavalier opens bright and fiery, with a crisp Italian red tangerine paired with a luscious saffron, leading into a rich floral leather heart. A warm, powerful base of oud and vanilla hums beautifully, a perfect chord with the still potent thread of saffron that continues to elevate the entire composition with a poised masculine gracefulness. Like a masterpiece that presents an iconic image in a way you've never before seen, Cuir Cavalier is a bold new portrait of a classic concept."," Italian red tangerine, saffron, rose, iris, cypriol, white honey, oud, soft leather, cedar, tonka bean, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36524.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chameleon Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs – an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing. What we do know, however, is that Zoologist Chameleon is a deliciously elusive blend of bright florals, hypnotic musks, and exotic fruit that can turn the wearer into anything they want to be. Madagascar, home to half of the world's species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island. Whether you desire to shroud yourself in an air of mystery, or blatantly flaunt your true colours, Chameleon becomes you."," Bergamot, Lemon, Madagascar Ylang Ylang, Mango, Pink Pepper, Star Fruit, Violet Leaves, Cashmeran, Clove, Coconut, Frangipani, Jasmine, Saffron, Salty Skin Accord, Sea Breeze, Amber, Woods, Musks, Opoponax, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dodo Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly from their nests, the birds waddled through the sea of luscious ferns that carpeted the forest floor, to feast on fat, ripe berries. For generations, the island paradise of Mauritius nurtured the dodos, its predator-free and bountiful shores lulling them into a state of such complacency that even their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately their evolution would betray them cruelly, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort. It's only appropriate, therefore, that Zoologist Dodo is as laid-back a fougere as you'll ever encounter- an ultra-fresh, green, delightfully whimsical blend of fruit, flower and moss that may just lull you into a sublime state of relaxation. Dodo opens with an invigorating burst of tart lime and juicy berries, inviting you to venture deep into a forest dense with vibrant ferns. Delicate fiddleheads unfurl to reveal tendrils of feathery musk, as rosy florals float up to embrace them. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic and iconic, yet eerily unknowable and endlessly fascinating. The ideal fougere for those with an eclectic sensibility, who crave a life of leisure and contentment."," Fern, Lime, Lychee, Raspberry, Ambergris, Fir Balsam, Geranium, Rose, Amber, Feathery Musk, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Blanc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," As with most perfumes in the Serge Lutens line, the name of the fragrance never gives you the full story. Santal Blanc means white sandalwood, but this is not light, airy sandalwood and its personality is far deeper than you might expect.  Built on a beautiful contrast of softness and piquancy, the fragrance opens with bursts of tangy pink pepper and fresh cedar notes, while its evolution brings out a creamy white sandalwood and beautifully unexpected twists of bitter cinnamon and fenugreek. Orris root (you'll recognize it as the scent of violets) rose and jasmine are background players, happy to let the woods, spices and musk mingle. Perfectly at ease on a man or woman, Santal Blanc is enigmatic and memorable, possessing enough mystery to keep you on your toes and wondering where its next evolution will take you-- forever changing, forever mysterious, forever enchanting."," White sandalwood, fenugreek, pink pepper, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, orris root, musk, benzoin, copaiba balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
City Of Jasmine Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," Summer in Damascus, when the jasmine blooms from every corner of the city. Well-dressed men stop to beat the afternoon heat with cool fresh fruits, or perhaps an icy drink of lemonade near a courtyard fountain. This is the portrait of City Of Jasmine, a delightfully refreshing masculine scent that takes the beloved and renowned structure of the fruit-forward men's scent to a newly exotic destination.The first notes of City Of Jasmine should be familiar to those on board with the fruity-masculine trend- a juicy, gently tart apple set against a musky leather for a wonderfully crisp and modern opening. But City Of Jasmine separates itself from the pack with a luscious floral heart, the complex, delicately indolic jasmine smoothed with a touch of rose for a seductive element of floral sophistication head and shoulders above the imitators. In the long-lasting base, a perfect touch of musk and vanilla provides contrast against the still-fresh leather note and adds the perfect final phase to an unforgettable, everyday-perfect scent.

Scent Of Paradise Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," The pure essence of springtime in Damascus, Scent Of Paradise is an unforgettable unisex citrus floral for free spirits and dreamers of all kinds. A blindingly fresh burst of bergamot-led citrus dazzles the senses, building into a perfectly blended, gently sweet floral heart that deftly balances lavender, rose, and iris against the still-present citrus for an unforgettable yet oh-so-easy-to-wear combination that lingers for hours, while a gentle base of ambery sandalwood soothes and relaxes without ever feeling overly warm or heavy. Enticing, romantic, sophisticated and outright fun, Scent Of Paradise is truly a citrus lover's dream: spray it on, close your eyes, and allow yourself to be carried away."," Bergamot, fruity notes, iris, rose, lavender, amber, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
From The Heart Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," Inspired by the lush beauty of the traditional Arab-Islamic courtyard house and the many fruits and flowers that flourished there in the days of Old Damascus, From The Heart is a thoroughly lovely and joyful scent. Like the traditional bitter orange trees that spread their distinctively fresh aroma through the courtyard, From The Heart opens bright and citrussy, with a lusciously sweet fruitiness from peach and ylang. At the core of the scent, a fully blooming flower garden exudes lush romanticism from the exquisite damask rose, as well as the full-bodied, sensual freshness of lily, all warmed by a subtle ambered base. Like the warm summer air wafting through the stately courtyard, From The Heart is an exuberant expression of freshness that lingers in the memory."," Bergamot, bitter orange, damask rose, lily, peach, ylang ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
King Of Flowers Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," In the Old City of Damascus, the narrow streets and ancient alleyways carry a dizzying, magical array of scents: fresh flowers from the marketplace, mouthwatering treats emerging hot from bakery ovens, exotic spices from bubbling pots in local kitchens. Taken together, these are the smells of a timeless community, and their indelible memory is the essence of King Of Flowers, a richly evocative extrait from Alghabra. Opening fresh, green, and citrussy, the composition soon deepens as the titular white flowers, warm and sensual, blossom in the heart of the fragrance against a smooth, creamy vanilla. A sophisticated touch of ambered leather makes us pause to think of the many travelers that have ventured these ancient streets- perhaps they, too, stopped to marvel at the wondrous combination of aromas on the warm summer breeze. If so, King Of Flowers would surely transport them back just as it does for us. A magical, whimsical, unforgettable scent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, amber, vanilla, white flowers, lavender, sandalwood, leather, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poem Of Damas Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums," If the notes list for Poem Of Damas seems a little vague, don't fret: you'll know exactly what you're smelling when you experience it, which is to say that Poem of Damas is one of the most straightforwardly confident, lush, downright gorgeous rose-oud scents we've ever encountered. Featuring an exquisite floral bouquet supplemented with the finest agarwood extract available on the market, Poem Of Damas seems to forego the traditional fragrance structure: the rich, dark, smooth oud explodes off the skin from the first spray, soon met with a lusciously rich Damascene rose, warm, romantic and completely captivating. Gently ambered tones of fruit and spice wax and wane throughout the life of the scent, sanding every rough edge and deepening the intense sophistication of the composition, which manages to feel hypnotically seductive and warmly comforting all at once, with a glow that lingers for untold hours. Simply put? This is rose oud as it was meant to be experienced."," Rose, floral notes, fruity notes, amber, oud, oriental notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Boha Parfum Extrait,Jeroboam," The power of a white flower, pristine and perfect, imposing in its unadorned beauty. This is the inspiration of Boha, an intensely lovely gardenia-led white floral that radiates sublimity and yet surrounds the wearer in provocation. Like staring into the sun, we open with the blinding freshness of electrically bright bergamot and bitingly green almond. As we adjust to the light, we bask in the sheer beauty of gardenia, romantic and opulent, blended perfectly with sweet orange blossom and lush jasmine. As with all Jeroboam scents, the base is built around their richly sensual Enigmatic Musks, along with warm amber and smooth, creamy Australian sandalwood for an unforgettably seductive base. White floral lovers, this one's emphatically for you."," Bergamot, green almond, violet leaves, gardenia, Egyptian jasmine, orange blossom, ambery woods, enigmatic musks, oakmoss, Australian sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patiala Extrait,Thameen," Created by Cartier in 1928 for an Indian Maharaja, the Patiala Necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery.  Containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. To this day, the disappearance has never been explained. In this spirit of opulence and mystery, Thameen presents Patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. Patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond. Yet it wears as comfortably as the necklace might around one who could afford it, with a rich, lush heart of orange flower and rose that anoints the bearer as royalty. A sweet, musky amber glows for countless hours, bathing us in serene reflected light. The original Patiala Necklace has sadly been lost to mystery, never to be experienced in its original glory again. But with this Patiala, we have a pretty good sense of just how it must have felt to experience such luxurious beauty."," Citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 02 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," While its sister scent Molecule 02 is built around the single note of ambroxan (the manmade equivalent of costly natural ambergris), Escentric 02 blends the note with vetiver and the cruelty-free musk imposter muscone. Add just a touch of orris, elderflower extract and the sunny, jasmine-like feel of hedione and it's light, refreshing and yes, even brisk fragrance that sparkles and enchants from beginning to end.  It's the kind of brisk you think of when smelling a freshly poured gin and tonic over lots and lots of ice, only Escentric has a fascinating mineral-like finish that amps things up to super spectacular. It's a wear  anytime, go anywhere type of scent with a very relaxed, unassuming nature...utterly at ease, totally uncomplicated and easy going, we find ourselves reaching for it over and over when everything else just seems not quite right that day. Escentric 02 fits the bill every time.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case, the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box."," Ambroxan, vetiver, muscone, orris, elderflower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Following on in the Escentric Molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the“meat” of a fragrance,  Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol,  a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen,  this could have been a disaster – Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is,  well,  too much. But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy,  creamy,  and steamy,  tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward,  and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light,  almost fresh,  with a green“stripped bark” note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness, ” says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree,  adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin,  giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case,  the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box.", Javanol,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to biehl parfumkunstwerke, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes – and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty“whiteness” that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer“my skin but better” scent for both men and women.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case, the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box."," Pink Grapefruit, Bergamot, Juniper Berry, Pink Pepper, Hedione, Freesia, Osmanthus, Orris, Rose, Javanol, Mastic, Labdanum, Iso E Super, Musk, Ambroxan, Castoreum, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30853.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
XJ Amber Gold & Rose Gold Collection Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," After the overwhelming reception for the exquisite Amber & Musk Collection (Star Musk and Amber Star), Xerjoff introduces another dynamic duo of unique fragrances that let you decide how you'd like to wear them, presented in a lavish and exclusive collector's set. Amber Gold is a luscious, vibrant delight that reflects the dazzling glow of amber with a sparkling cascade of juicy citrus and spicy florals.

A compellingly woodsy base of patchouli and musk further deepens our seduction.Worn together, florals, fruits and ambers weave into a complex and sensually compelling symphony, powerful and beautiful in equal measure, uniquely balanced each time you wear it."," Amber Gold: Tangerine, coriander, orange flower, tobacco flower, almond blossom, patchouli, musk, amberRose Gold: Bulgarian rose, Egyptian geranium, Indonesian patchouli, amber, musk, buddah wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/511051.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aura Perfume Oil,Essential Faith," The cult classic success of the original Essential Faith was undeniable evidence that there's nothing sexier than individuality- after all, the barely-there blend of exquisitely soft, musky oils was less of a perfume in any traditional sense and more a supercharged enhancement of your natural essence, blending seamlessly with each wearer to smell distinctively different on anyone. With Aura, the intoxicating original Essential Faith formula returns with an appropriately subtle supplement, a perfectly portioned dollop of exquisite vanilla, which adds a warming, seductive twist to the sublime freshness of the original. Creamy, cozy, not overly sweet, this is vanilla that glows with ambered tones, drawing people in for an unforgettable closer sniff. A divinely delicious second skin, Aura may not be for those who like their fragrances loud- but for those who value being true to themselves above all, it's downright essential.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Allende Parfum,Xerjoff," Allende is a gift fallen from the sky. A rare perfume, like the meteorite for which this powerful creation draws its name. A sophisticated magnolia-based harmony reverberates in the heart notes, whilst an intoxicating slipstream of Madagascar vanilla drapes the entire blend. Notes of cream, spice, florals and soft earth swirl majestically, making the mouth water and the pulse soar. Mysterious and magical, delicious and deceptively deep, Allende is a more-than-a-gourmand vanilla with sensuality to spare."," Vanilla Madagascar, magnolia, cocoa",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51150.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The spice, an eye-popping blend of cumin, saffron, and black pepper, bursts though the inky richness of the lush rose and deep oud, letting a few tantalizing rays of light through to balance the seductive darkness. As the rich, refined leather base supports and enriches the warmth of the woods, we realize how completely we are under its spell, enchanted and deeply content. An oud fragrance for lovers and mystics alike, Aoud Exclusif is not to be missed."," Labdanum, spicy cumin, saffron, pepper, rose, violet, patchouli, oud, leather, vanilla, amber, white musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64937.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Vanilla Shot Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," The first of the Sepia Collection, a bold trio of Parfum Extraits from legendary perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, Vanilla Shot is an extraordinary scent. Inspired by a photograph of a breathtaking Land Art sculpture from Martin Hill- an arch made of dry reeds suspended weightlessly above New Zealand's Wanaka Lake- Duchaufour delivers an equally gravity-defying fragrance that contrasts the deep, indulgent richness of pure vanilla with intensely fresh elements for a luminously oriental experience.  Our expectations for a vanilla scent are disposed of almost instantly, as Vanilla Shot opens with a stimulating jolt of electric spice- coriander and saffron, supplemented with an ultra-clean aldehyde sparkle. But as with Hill's photograph, balance is paramount, and before our fragrance gets carried into the clouds a rich heart of dried fruit, warm opoponax, and fresh rose tethers us again to the land, hinting of depth yet to come. Against this deeply sensual contrast, we encounter a rich base of complex, creamy vanilla and sweet, warm resins, soothing and seducing even while the fresh elements continue to reach skyward, achieving a wondrous, poetic geometry that lingers for hours. A new high water mark for Olfactive Studios, Vanilla Shot is a unique, compelling accomplishment a world away from your typical vanilla fragrance."," Coriander, saffron, aldehydes, rose, dried fruits, opoponax, vanilla, caramel, myrrh, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Kiso Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Spare, serene, and deceptively deep, Amber Kiso is an enchanting new vision of an amber fragrance through the prism of feudal Japan. It's amber stripped down to its essence- an abstraction of captured light- taking a decidedly eastern alternative to the traditional labdanum-and-vanilla representation of European-style amber scents. Instead, Amber Kiso is a vision of sunlight piercing the tranquility of an ancient forest, the brightness of fresh moss against the unique strength of cedar and hinoki. A tendril of temple incense, pure and contemplative, winds itself throughout the heart of the scent, while a clean, smooth leather represents the traditional bushi armor of a samurai. Elegant and spiritual, Amber Kiso is unlike any amber we've encountered before- and we're lost in its spell."," Japanese cedar, incense, cypress, maple, patchouli, iris, hinoki, leather, treemoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68681.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Teutonic Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," As the companion scent to the Japanese-inspired Amber Kisu, you'd be forgiven for thinking the oh-so-European-named Amber Teutonic would be constructed in the more traditional labdanum-and-vanilla style amber form. However, we're delighted to report that Teutonic, inspired by the breathtaking old-growth forests of Austria and Germany, turns out to be every bit as creative as its counterpart, envisioning an amber alive with aromatic freshness, bursting with notes of pine, templin (fir) cone, and bright, stout cedarwood. A distinctively bright accord of cardamom and green mandarin adds to the luminous glow, while a rich base of smooth musk and sweet, balsamic opoponax provide a soothingly familiar amber warmth. Escape to a still mythic world of towering ancient trees and magical creatures- Amber Teutonic is an adventure in a bottle."," Alpine cedar, cardamom, green mandarin, geranium, European larch, templin cone, pine, opoponax, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68682.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Each Other Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by the wild and wonderful street art of THoO founder Andrea Casotti's native Milan, Each Other is a collaboration with famed Milanese graffiti writer KayOne that uses an electrifying contrast of bright and dark notes to represent the urban vitality of their shared hometown. The fragrance opens high in the clouds, with a blinding burst of citrus shining like a ray of light on the iconic outline of the Duomo di Milano. But there's much more to this vibrant, bustling metropolis than tourist attractions, and Each Other quickly takes to the living, breathing streets, the colorful graffiti represented in fiery spice and rich aromatics. As the sun sets and the stylish young Milanese come out to play, nightfall takes the intriguingly bitter contrast of calamus and wormwood, like a strong cocktail to start the evening. Finally, warm labdanum and luminous vetiver represent the city lit up, inviting and intimidating, alive in its contradictions. Discover the true complexity of Milan with Each Other- a dynamic fragrance for a city that deserves nothing less."," Citrus blend, grapefruit, pink pepper, coriander, calamus, wormwood, labdanum, ambergris, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76424.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1900 L'Heure de Proust Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," 1900, the height of La Belle Epoque. Legendary author Marcel Proust and a cherished confidante retire to the bains sulfureux for a day of elaborate pampering- steam, massage, and a grand tea service to while away the private hours. The delicacies enjoyed in these intimate moments make up the magical scent of 1900 L'Heure de Proust. Our service begins with the exquisite fruits used to flavour the tea, tart, bright grapefruit and lusciously juicy blueberry, set against the smoky richness of pure black tea and the refined leather upholstering the private couch to where our subjects have retired. The unisex freshness of violet perfumes the wood-panelled room, while a tray of mouthwatering desserts- sweet pralines and creamy vanilla cake- beckon our indulgence. The scent is gorgeous, delightful, masculine and feminine intertwined- far from scandalous, but equally far from innocent. Indeed, when naming a scent for Proust, the bar is raised- and we're delighted to say that 1900 L'Heure de Proust is evocative enough to inspire a masterpiece of your own."," Bergamot, blueberry, grapefruit, violet, black tea, Tuscan leather, mate, gaiac, praline, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blanc Poudre Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," Inspired by the pure whiteness of French Porcelain, Blanc Poudre is a masterful testament to the sophistication of perfect, clean simplicity. Glowing with an impossibly smooth blend of pristine cotton flower and vintage rice powder, the opening of Blanc Poudre is hypnotically soft, glowing with a luminous freshness that hides a barely perceptible sweetness beneath. As a pillowy heart of white musk floats into the picture, a masterfully deployed dollop of sandalwood and vanilla reveals the depths of this disarmingly simple, wonderfully precise blend. For those who desire a clean that goes far beyond soapy department store musks, Blanc Poudre is a pristine treasure."," Cotton flower, rice powder, white musk, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sweet Flowers Eau de Parfum,Montale," Sweet and fresh, fresh and sweet... so often in perfume, we find one at the expense of the other, resigned to the idea that what makes our mouths water and what makes our hearts flutter are mutually exclusive. And then a wonderfully romantic confection like Sweet Flowers crosses our nose, and we fall in love all over again. Vibrant and nimble with tingling spice and airy florals and, yet lusciously laced with sugared fruits and creamy vanilla, Sweet Flowers is the best of both worlds, a rare low-calorie dessert that actually delivers on its promise. Youthful yet sexy, gourmand yet guilt-free, Sweet Flowers is a pop of pure joy you'll need to smell for yourself."," Bergamot, white peach, ginger, spicy pepper, cotton candy, patchouli, jasmine, tuberose, violet, vanilla, oakmoss, grey amber, white musk, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bakhoor,Montale," Born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the Middle East, a Bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a Mabkhara. The resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. As a perfume, Bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. For those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss Bakhoor."," Oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Leather Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale," Let's get one thing clear- Leather Patchouli is not a gourmand scent. After all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. You'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as Leather Patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. The result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear."," Leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Musk Eau de Parfum,Montale," Montale, admittedly, is not known for subtlety- their bold perfumes wear their powerful Middle Eastern influences proudly, and as a result have become beloved of those craving fragrances of beastly projection and sillage. But that doesn't mean the venerable Parisian house doesn't do subtle from time to time, and the latest example- the warm, mysterious,  Amber Musk- may be their best skin scent yet. Like a gentle caress, sweet, warm notes of amber glide tenderly above the skin, contrasting notes of clean powder against a soft, seductively musky current of animalic sensuality. It lingers on the skin for hours, leaving a trail of warm carnality in its wake, drawing those around you in ever closer. A true secret weapon if ever there was one, Amber Musk isn't like your typically beastly Montale scent- and it's all the sexier for it."," Sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mefisto Gentiluomo Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Mefisto Gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in Italy circa 1888. Like its progenitor, Mefisto, Gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery – clean – and makes it sexy again. Think the steamy aromas in a traditional Italian barbershop after a shave – triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. Yes, Gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.Right off the bat, Mefisto Gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. It wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. Salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel – not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. We're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. But if Mefisto Gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a Mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a Florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. The flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. Handsome, refined, and full of Italian braggadocio, Mefisto Gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018."," bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Uden Overdose Parfum,Xerjoff," Who says perfection can't be improved upon? Though the name Uden Overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original Uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. How does it differ, you ask? Well, while Uden Overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original – the essence of its ”˜fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of Uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. Both are utterly charming in their different ways. But if original Uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, Uden Overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay.  Uden Overdose opens similarly to Uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. But while original Uden turns creamy with vanilla, Uden Overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. Think a tannic Earl Grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. It smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. Tobacco blossom plays a central role in Uden Overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. Woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. This one's such a pleasure to wear. If you love fougeres (and the original Uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then Uden Overdose is your man."," Bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Colognise Extrait de Cologne,Nishane," In Turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent. With Colognise, Nishane, a house well-known for rich, long-lasting extraits, takes this beloved custom and modernizes it into a dynamic, sexy, wonderfully easy-to-wear ""extrait de cologne""- a concentration that captures all of the vibrance and exuberance of a traditional citrus cologne, in a much longer-lasting 18% concentration. On first spray, Colognise positively explodes with bright, fresh lemon and bergamot, a fitting tribute to the simple, beautiful lemon colognes of its inspiration- but even in the opening, a smooth, beautiful green tea note hints at the greater complexity that lies ahead. Soon, an rich, emerging floral heart of lily and jasmine adds dimensionality and lush, unisex character, even as the citrus continues to sparkle. A sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once. Created in the spirit of hospitality, Colognise is so very effortless to wear that you'll have to decide whether to share it with everyone- or keep it all for yourself."," Bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77451.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Savile Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," A dedication to masculine elegance, Savile deftly interprets the mythical fougere in chiaroscuro, reflecting the timeless chic-style and sophistication of bohemian artists haunting London's Mayfair during the 1960s. Fresh aromatic top notes of Provence lavender evolve into a rounder and more voluptuous scent enveloped in suede and woodsy-amber. Unforgettably alluring."," Citrus notes, Lavandin of Luberon, orris, jasmine sambac, suede, Virginian tobacco, cedar wood, patchouli, amber, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16469.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

This is a big, bright citrus, bathed in hazy California sunshine. Smooth sandalwood and rich amber provide a warm, sensuous, golden base, and a hint of patchouli gives it all a little something extra – because it wouldn't be canyon living without a little patchouli in the mix, would it?  The powerful base notes match the brightness of the citrus, resulting in an exceptionally attractive and well-balanced scent that captures California dreamin' perfectly."," Citrus, petit grain, hint of patchouli, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16461.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isles Lointaines Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," Picture yourself on a tropical island in the South Seas, so small it has no name, no corporate entities and no cell phone reception – just gorgeous beaches, turquoise skies and a profusion of white flowers in full bloom. All you have to do is lie on the sparkling sand, listen to the waves and dream the day away.  It might be awhile before we can afford that private South Sea island, but Isles Lointaines is the next best thing. This brazenly flirtatious potion features an incredibly lush gardenia double-whammy by blending traditional gardenia with tiare, also known as Tahitian gardenia, and the result is every bit as seductive and gorgeous as you would expect.

Datura Blanche Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," Opening with an airy, lemon-like freshness, Datura Blanche announces from the beginning that is going to focus on the delicate beauty of the datura flower – ethereal and alluring with a hint of spice. A watercolor wash of tuberose and heliotrope heighten the dreamy sweetness, while a dark splash of bitter almond draws out the intriguing, narcotic aspects that make datura so notoriously provocative. In this elegant composition, the dark side whispers seductively, but never overpowers the gossamer beauty of the white flowers. A luxurious bed of tonka and vanilla adds opulence and warmth.  This has the luminous beauty of a moonlit garden – the white blooms glowing amid the velvety shadows."," white datura, Indian tuberose, heliotrope, bitter almond, tonka bean, vanilla madagascar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16430.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Irisistible Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," How do you describe a scent when its own name says it all? Irisistible, by far April Aromatics' most ambitious scent yet, is a powerhouse of floral beauty, a showcase for a divine collection of rare and expensive natural materials sure to make toes curl with pleasure. At the center is an exquisite, unforgettable Italian iris pallida, the single most exclusive material ever used in a Tanja Bochnig creation, a buttery, iridescent, rooty floral with exceptional fidelity, laid down into a lush, vibrant bed of equally gorgeous supporting notes: the sparkling brightness of Italian lemon, the narcotic sensuality of Indian tuberose and jasmine, the romantic fullness of Bulgarian rose, and the fiery cinnamon spice of Sri Lankan cassia. The combination is something beyond beautiful, achieving a blissfully full-bodied lusciousness that, in true April Aromatics fashion, sidesteps the stereotypes of natural perfumery to evoke grand, romantic fragrances of bygone eras. Sure, we might have said this fragrance was impossible to describe, but once we experienced the first spritz on skin, well- we simply couldn't resist."," Lemon, iris, jasmine, rose, tuberose, cassia, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kolonya Eau de Toilette,Rasei Fort," Inspired by Rasei Fort's earliest childhood memories of time with his grandfather- his garden of blooming jasmine and lemon trees, the classic eau de cologne faded into his crisply starched shirt- Kolonya is an intensely personal scent, a true labor of love that echoes with the warmth of pleasantly fuzzy recollection. An imposing list of notes- citrus, spice, florals, moss, woods, resins- nonetheless coalesces into a hypnotically soothing whole, a smooth chord progression of gently wistful etherea that sits softly on the skin, yet will surprise you with moments of profound recognition throughout the day. Not so much a cologne as the memory of a cologne, Kolonya is more than mere fragrance- it's genuine emotion, captured on skin.Please note: Kolonya is a splash style bottle."," Bergamot, Neroli, Petitgrain, Clove, Nutmeg, White Pepper, Bitter Orange, Pink Grapefruit, Blood Orange, Rosewood, Orange Blossom, Rose, Coriander, Galbanum, Rosemary, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Geranium, Lavender, Angelica Root, Black Plum, Indian Vetiver, Oakmoss, Hay, Amber, Benzoin, Sandalwood, Virginian Cedarwood, Musk, Tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/80800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud for Greatness Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," The concept of“sacred geometry, ” the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness,  is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large,  transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It's a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don't know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible."," Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Hyde Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," A venomously enchanting potion to turn the meek into monsters, Hyde is an unforgettably dark and smoky leather spiked with bolts of green, spicy florals. A flash of bright citrus marks the start of the transformation, and is quickly overtaken with a sensually sinister smokiness that fills the senses and floods the imagination. As your perception adjusts, the intensity of the smoke makes way for the subtleties that lie within, courtesy of the Cassie flower, a unique relative of mimosa with distinctly spicy and fresh green characteristics. But Hyde is a beastly fragrance through and though, and even as the complexity grows, complete with resinous labdanum and smooth, malted vanilla, the overall effect is captivatingly dark, intensely powerful, and wholly unforgettable. Let the power of Hyde transform you, but be warned- there may be no turning back."," Lemon, bergamot, birch tar, acacia, cistus labdanum, malt, vanilla, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Square Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Red is the color of passion, of warning, of danger. And what can we say? We hate to be all ”˜matchy-matchy', but Red Square sure lives up to its name! It scoops up some of the fieriest ”˜red' notes in perfumery, like red pepper, red musk, clove or cinnamon, and padauk wood, an African rosewood, and whips them up into a hot blaze, cooling them down again with ash and aromatics for a never-ending dance of hot and cold that holds the wearer's attention throughout. Key to Red Square's exciting aroma is nar (meaning ”˜fire' in Arabic), a rare red Boswellia sacra frankincense from Oman that has a fresh, spicy pine-like aroma pitched halfway between elemi and cinnamon bark. The opening is a column of white smoke billowing from a censer where elemi resin burns over eucalyptus branches, liquid tar, and cloves, its trail purified by an antiseptic ginger note. We love the minty, camphoraceous aspect of the incense, because it injects a leafy bitterness. Before we get too comfortable, however, Red Square plunges everything into a bath of hot pitch, like Eau Lente poured into the La Brea tar pits. This gutsy move is what transforms what could have been just a nice incense scent into something mesmerizingly different. The scent continues on in this spiced, musky tar-like track for a while before smoothing out into a peppery incense accord that reminds us of the aldehydic coldness of Avignon (Comme des Garcons) or LAVS (UNUM). We recommend Red Square to anyone who thinks that incense no longer holds any surprises. Although it riffs off the bone structure of some of the greats, Red Square takes us in some new and surprising directions."," padauk wood, red frankincense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noir Encens Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Noir Encens is based on the scent of Mad et Len's beautiful Noir Encens potpourri – little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils – as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 No. XLIII Encens. The 2018 Noir Encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing High Mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. The almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. One thing is for sure, though: Noir Encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. Smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. If you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as FÃ¨ve DÃ©licieuse by Dior PrivÃ©e, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, or Le Baiser du Dragon by Cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on Mad et Len's 2018 Noir Encens."," amber, frankincense, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Changing Constance Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Sister to Lady Blanche, Constance is what one would call a very modern woman. Her opening blend of cool cardamom and hot pimento is modern, to say the least, and is bound to deliver a dynamically fresh and spicy thrill. Still possessing a mild affinity to her favourite childhood treat, Constance can always be found sucking on a butter salted caramel as she twirls her Turkish cigar, clad in perfectly tailored cashmere trousers. Irreverent, stylish, and unquestionably contemporary, Changing Constance isn't a fragrance for every woman, which is assuredly exactly the way she likes it."," Cardamom, pimento, salted butter, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

And The World Is Yours Extrait de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," Few photographs capture the sumptuousness of celebrity more than the iconic photograph of Faye Dunaway by famed English photographer Terry O'Neill. The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?And the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion's signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope””apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish. Like Dunaway in the photograph, And the World Is Yours is stylish, sexy- and still basking in the afterglow of last night's adventures."," Neroli, cumin, orange blossom absolute, rose, heliotrope, sandalwood, vanilla pod CO2,  tonka absolute, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
But Not Today Extrait de Parfum,UNUM," UNUM's But Not Today is named for that chilling moment in Silence of the Lambs when Dr. Hannibal Lecter sniffs Clarice Starling and leers,“You use Evian skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today”. But Not Today is UNUM's scented capsule of the tension of that moment, where the pearly innocence of L'Air du Temps' carnation and lily, as worn by the fresh-faced Clarice Starling, faces off against the depraved bloodlust of castoreum, blood, and metal knives slicing through air, as represented by Hannibal himself. But Not Today's bloodcurdling mix of sweet indoles with blood, dust, and metal makes for an unsettling but strangely beautiful wear. But Not Today would be a great choice for anyone who prefers smelling interesting to merely pretty. Past the animalic roar of the bloody leather at the start, the scent develops into a spicy-floral gourmand that combines the culinary herb-and-spice-rack of Italian perfumery with creamy white flowers, freshened with the peppery greenness of lily. The powdery carnation that emerges in the base gives the scent an alluring ”˜old school' vibe redolent of the spicy leather drydowns of Caron's Tabac Blonde and En Avion. But Not Today is therefore that rare bird - possessed of both an avant-garde and retro character, but dominated by neither. But Not Today smells unique and doesn't compare easily to other fragrances. However, if you love scents such as Eva Kant by O'Driu, Vierges et Toreros by Etat Libre d'Orange, and Noun by Bogue, cut with the retro spice powder of L'Air du Temps and Tabac Blond, then waste no time in getting your nose on But Not Today."," Metal, lily, jasmine, leather, castoreum, carnation, animal notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violon Basse 16 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Thunderously dark, imposingly deep, Violon Basse 16 is a virtuosic performance of bassy, rich, impossibly smoky leather. Drawing its name from a wood or metal organ register that adds rich, imposing effect to the notes played, the scent more than replicates this function, lending the wearer a supernaturally powerful smokiness given subtle nuance with striking incense tones and dark notes of wood and leather. Sensual doesn't even begin to describe it- this is entrancing, primordial, sublime. Lovers of smoke scents- do not miss Violon Basse 16.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unda Maris 8 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Unda Maris (""wave of the sea"") is an organ stop that plays two pipes of differing registers together, the higher and lower notes producing a rolling sound evocative of the flowing ocean. An olfactive version of this effect is at the center of Unda Maris 8, which features a montage of bright, fresh, and authentically oceanic notes (though without an official notes list, we're left to guess) against a ""lower register"" of warm, resinous woodsy and incensey tones, creating a beautiful and ever-evolving series of harmonies. One moment, the fragrance is all salty air and citrus zest, the next, warmly textured, spiced florals and incense- but always defined by the negative space between the highs and lows. It's not so much a shapeshifter as a fragrance of consistent mass but infinitely variable dimensions, each moment a new permutation to enjoy. Flowing, fascinating, and deeply soothing, Unda Maris 8 is that rare gem that perfectly delivers on a high concept while remaining oh so wonderfully wearable.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Heure Exquise 2020 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," Spring in Paris has almost become summer today. The shades of evening begin to descend. You sit in a cafe in the city center and look at the Seine. The sun goes down and the colors of the day mix with the purple sky. The familiar outlines of objects are faded by pastel tones, your eyes rest, and your feelings become stronger. The waiter brings you a cup of cocoa and a dessert. Dusky air cools your face and you feel the richness of scents brighter than ever before: the beverage, the food and a bouquet of flowers nearby. It is L'heure Exquise. The fragrance starts with a soft mix of Cardamom and Citruses. In a moment you get into a whirlpool of spicy notes of Cocoa, Clove and Myrrh. The heart of the fragrance beats with floral notes of exotic Champaca and Jasmine. Indonesian and Vietnamese Oud, Tolu Balsam and delicate White Amber are warming the beautiful base of the fragrance.Same formula, new 2020 batch with a re-worked, smoother Oud accord"," Bergamot, neroli, cardamom, champaca, champaca leaf, jasmine, attar motia, cedar, cacao, clove, camphor, nagarmotha, myrrh, Vietnamese oud roots, Indonesian oud, styrax, tolu balsam, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Southern Bloom Perfume Concentrate,Goldfield & Banks," Though originally native to Western Australia, the boronia- a rare flowering shrub with a distinctive sweet and woodsy aroma- has thrived in the wilds of Tasmania. Now it's the centrepiece of Southern Bloom, the newest, most elegantly feminine release yet from Goldfield & Banks. Featuring a pure boronia flower absolute harvested from ruggedly beautiful Bruny Island during the renowned September ""Spring Bloom"" season, Southern Bloom is lavishly romantic, with smooth, rich white florals enhancing the sweet sophistication of the central ingredient, while a suite of fresh and earthy notes- French cassis, native Australian sandalwood, and Javan vetiver- sustains and celebrates boronia's more unique characteristics. The results are a floral scent both refined and naturalistic, where floral sweetness, creamy woodsiness, and earthy green tones mesh seamlessly. As a proof of Goldfield & Banks' thesis that exquisite natural materials ought to be showcased in all of their three-dimensional glory, it's already a winner. As a versatile, sensual floral appropriate for any occasion, it's downright marvelous."," Tasmanian boronia, cassis, mandarin, ylang ylang, jasmine, iris, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Am Trash Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Put aside the marketing for a minute - no, I Am Trash (or Les Fleurs du DÃ©chet) does not smell like trash! Etat Libre d'Orange is a brand known for making high concept art, and this is no exception. In I Am Trash, the idea is to raise awareness about the continued usefulness of the things that normally get thrown away, and find a way to upcycle these items to create something beautiful in its own right. I Am Trash is a perfume made entirely from ”˜found objects' like the fruit peels and wood chips leftover from extraction by the perfume or food industry. This makes perfect sense. After all, some of the most exquisite materials in perfumery derive from waste. Ambergris, for example, is effluvia from a whale washed up on a beach. Oud is a tree's white cell response to a fungal infection. And so on and so forth. But fear not, for I Am Trash is as far from the ruder, dirtier aspects of nature's waste as you can imagine. It is a gentle fruity-floral that wraps a woodland bouquet of wild strawberries, apple, rose, and citrus rind up in a frothy musk and asks you to forgive it its dramatic back story. Nothing dark or rotting lurks in the corners. This is a purely bright, sunny concoction of fruits and flowers, with clean musks, radiant Iso E Super, and a dab of creamy sandalwood in the base pinning it all together. Etat Libre d'Orange could have named this I Am Joy and nobody would blink. But we love the name I Am Trash because it's a reminder to be more thoughtful about what we throw away, and testament to the fact that, sometimes, out of trash comes true beauty."," bitter orange, apple, lemongrass, tangerine, rose, Iso E Super, wild strawberry, Atlas cedar, Sandalore, Akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47753.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noble XXI Cypress Parfum,Clive Christian," Clive Christian Cypress is a beautifully-made masculine that manages to capture the magic of a French Riviera night, where the spicy greenness of the breeze sweeping through tall cypress trees mingles with the effervescence of freshly-poured champagne. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda boozing it up in a citrus grove in Nice, the tinkle of laughter and light jazz floating on the warm night air, and that's the mood board right there for the scent. The opening to Cypress is surprisingly spicy, thick with cloves, cinnamon, ginger root, and the anisic mintiness of fresh basil. But it's also immensely fresh and sour, a lively undercurrent of tart bergamot playing off the green bitterness of cypress. Fans of the balsamic soapiness of Jaipur Homme will recognize echoes in Cypress, but where the Boucheron burrows deep into an opoponax base, Cypress swerves into an elegant essay on the dry richness of woods. In the base, a handsome pairing of oakwood and cedarwood knits together a rich weave of smoke, toasted wood, and spice until you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. In the far reaches of the scent, rich amber swells up to thicken the woods, adding weight but not sweetness. If anyone is feeling short-changed by the dearth in good masculines these days, then point them in the direction of Clive Christian Cypress – they won't be disappointed."," petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champ de Fleurs Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Anne Flipo revisits of one of her most influential perfumes: 1999's La Chasse Aux Papillons. An impossibly soft, transparent tuberose that spells out spring in capital letters. In Champ de Fleurs, Flipo keeps the airy white floral in place, but takes it in a new and interesting direction. First, she freshens the topnotes with bitter grapefruit and a juicy pear note, giving the floral heart an icy ”˜morning dew' feel. Second, perhaps more significantly, she bolsters the airy tuberose with a creamy, full-fat pairing of gardenia and jasmine, so that the contrast between the fresh eau de cologne-style notes in the opening and the buttery floral heart feels even more dramatic. Velvety, creamy, and hovering somewhere between suggestive and innocent, Champ de Fleurs lingers on the skin and in the air for hours. It melts into the muskiness of your own skin, forming an aura that will leave people wondering if you're perfumed or have just been luxuriating in a long, steamy bath with honey and milk soap. Like La Chasse Aux Papillons and Chanel Beige, Champ de Fleurs is suggestive of springtime meadows but in an abstract, impressionistic way – you smell the gardenia, the tuberose, and the crisp green muguet not as a living, breathing flower per se, but as a gently creamy floral watercolor that swirls all the colors together. Unabashedly feminine, we see Champ de Fleurs as the perfect choice for those who prefer a discreetly luxurious symphony of spring flowers over the loud, fleshy sexiness of a tuberose or gardenia solo."," grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pavillon Rouge Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," Dashingly spicy, mouthwateringly rich, Pavillon Rouge is an intriguingly unisex gourmand fragrance inspired by an age where pirates, admirals, and merchants all sought their fortune on the high seas. It's a dashing galleon flying the Jolly Roger, holds laden with exotic spices, glimmering treasure in dark wooden chests, and warm, rich liquors. It's the sensual elegance of a masked privateer clad in colorful silks and well worn leather, puffing a billowing pipe as he recounts adventures past and lovers left behind. Sweet and spicy, rich and boozy, tobacco, rum, and vanilla, all combine in a sweepingly romantic fragrance that boldly declares that a short, exciting life is infinitely preferable to a long and boring one. Throw off the doldrums of everyday life, and try Pavillon Rouge today- it's high time you started an adventure."," Spices, sesame, whisky, rum, coffee, tobacco, tea, leather, vanilla, ebony wood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61616.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Forty Thieves Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," From dusk ”˜til dawn,  a vast desert land, Camel caravans through the golden sand. Among the Bedouins they would retreat,   Surrounded by tea,  spices and delicacies to eat.A warm breeze carries the incense smoke,   Laughter around the shisha as they joke.  At nightfall,  they return to their coveted treasure,  Hidden in a cave,  it's a sight of pleasure.“Open Sesame”,  enter if you please,  To the mystical tale of the Forty Thieves.The latest in Fort & Manle's stunning slate of gorgeous,  idiosyncratic fragrances,  Forty Thieves is a sweet,  lush,  mouthwatering gem of a scent that weaves as dashing a tale as the original legend of Ali Baba himself. Vivid bursts of juicy bergamot and crackling pink pepper evoke the swirling oasis of the legendary hidden cave,  while a richly resinous floral heart suggests the untold treasures that lay within. A robustly balsamic base boasts sensusal warmth,  combining the comfort of vanilla with the deep mysteries of oud,  resulting in the unique balance of delightful wearability and utter originality that seems to distinguish every Fort & Manle scent. At the risk of overstating the theme,  Forty Thieves is undeniably worth its weight in gold."," Bergamot, pink pepper, petitgrain, incense, labdanum, papyrus, rose, honey, orange blossom, amber, sandalwood, oud, vanilla, balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love & Crime Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo," In 1905, a lovestruck young woman named Mazie Coyle devised a scheme to break her fiancee out of prison that would later become legendary- a hacksaw baked into a wedding cake. It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break."," Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Lord Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Dangerously sophisticated, Dark Lord is both a fragrance of impeccable manners and seductive wickedness. It's a scent for gentlemen and scoundrels alike, both bold and subtle, constructed around a rich, gorgeous extract of raw Haitian vetiver and an intriguing blend of fruit-inflected, bright Sichuan pepper and electric bourbon pepper, smoothed behind a refined facade of leather and rum. Each supporting note- spicy, sweet, boozy, smooth, and earthy- coaxes out a corresponding facet of the vetiver, resulting in a men's fragrance with impressive versatility- in an office, worn with a sensible suit, it exudes suave, dignified elegance, while simultaneously adding a dangerous allure to a night out on the town- exactly what Kilian Hennessy had in mind from the beginning. Sure, you're just a regular, mild-mannered guy- but with a dash of Dark Lord, you can be so much more."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Princesses de Malabar Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Legends tell of the mythical Princesses of the Malabar coast of western India, wise women who ruled their kingdom with wisdom and equanimity; in the 18th century, their tale became a shorthand for gracious, fair, female leadership. Now, in a time where that quality is disappointingly ephemeral, Lubin delivers a fragrance meant to inspire and enchant a new generation of empowered women. Bursting with fruity-floral energy that floats into a gorgeously weightless cloud of powdery musk, Princesses of Malabar is a bridge between past and present, a thoroughly modern and delightful feminine scent with an undeniable link to the glamorous perfumes of centuries past. Princesses of Malabar opens with the dynamic sparkle of aldehydes and citrus, a bathing light that cleanses palette and soul to make way for the rich but never-heavy fruity floral base- a juicy spritz of peach, the sumptuous lushness of magnolia, the sexy-sweet combination of jasmine and ylang. It's every bit as fun and youthful as the latest mass market blockbuster, only a thousand times more sophisticated. The contrast is only heightened in the vintage-inspired base, which deploys the powdery strength of iris atop a pillow-soft confection of amber, musk, and tonka, flirting with the mouthwatering appeal of a gourmand while never tipping into over-sugared dessert territory. It's a sublime formula, as fun as it is formal, as sweet as it is smooth, as fresh as it is fancy- a 21st century feminine scent for the young at heart and old souls alike. We could all use a bit of royal inspiration in these trying times, and Princesses de Malabar seems destined to become a new classic."," Cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, Arabian jasmine, Nosy Be ylang ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/312028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Liquid Illusion Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Liquid Illusion opens with such a lush, fruity almond note that we instantly picture Marie Antoinette wearing it, giggling with girlfriends as she nibbles on pastel-colored petit fours.  It's over-the-top delicious. Heliotrope, the tiny purple flower that smells like cherries and marzipan, ramps up the nutty gourmandise of this opening, but also ushers in a tart floral freshness that breathes air into the rafters. But Liquid Illusion is not just a fluffy gourmand delight (although it's certainly that, too). After a while, you become aware of the scaffolding beneath, with its complex system of cantilevers designed to keep those almond topnotes aloft. In particular, iris absolute, its shy aroma strengthened and made incredibly diffusive by irone and iracine (iris root oil compounds), casts a berried, violety forcefield around the scent. Tuberose absolute shows up, but comes armed with a girlish bubblegum nuance rather than its usual full desk of indole and rubber. The mix of all these floral and fruit elements is irresistible because it teeters on the line between innocent and seductive, girlish and come-hither. Benzoin imparts a gritty, brown sugar texture to the base that will make you want to bite your arm, but the real stars are the creamy tonka bean and musks, back-up generators of real balsamic warmth. Liquid Illusion is just the thing for when things just feel really bleak; a floral that skips the usual arm's-length froideur of flowers and offers you delicious, seductive warmth instead."," Heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love Tuberose Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Are you on a diet? Well, sorry, because Love Tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. Amouage's second installment in its ”˜Secret Garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. Eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, Love Tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more trÃ¨s leches cake. Picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. Honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. The Chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. Love Tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. An unabashedly feminine scent, Love Tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. But would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? No - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone."," tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41894.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tonka 25 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Le Labo's first release in three years, we think Tonka 25 was worth the wait. An addictively dark and warm fragrance, Tonka 25 captures the humid funk of a forest's undergrowth, teeming with the buzz of insects, seeds, and resin. True to form for any Le Labo fragrance, tonka is a part of the composition but not the whole story. The crushed almond heft of tonka bean absolute is detectable in the background, where it infuses the perfume with aromatic woodsmoke, but for us, the real star of the show is the cedar, followed by musk and orange flower.The Atlas cedar in Tonka 25 is spicy, humid, and almost dank, creating an impression of woodrot that's enhanced by a swirl of vegetal musks. For a moment, we're reminded of the animalic topnote of Oud 27, but this is less alien, far more human: warm, enveloping, and very sexy. The furred darkness of the woods and musk at the heart of Tonka 25 holds sway for much of the scent's life, but we'd be remiss in not mentioning the extraordinary orange flower absolute. Orange blossom's gift to Tonka 25 is a green, waxy brightness that feels like a honey candle glowing through a knot of hemp. Finally, enter styrax resin, blessing the drydown with a leathery, smoky richness. If you're looking for something that will comfort and titillate in equal measure, then put Le Labo Tonka 25 on top of your test list. Dark woods expanded by creamy animalic musks, crushed tonka, and smoky resin, backlit by silky orange flower....a glowering Heathcliff in a bottle.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

A Rose For... Eau de Parfum,Floris London," Every rose is beautiful in its own special way; every novel combination of species, vintage and terroir combines to produce a rose with a scent all its own, not to mention a meaning and emotional impact unique to its lucky recipient. It's with this in mind that Floris has given us A Rose For, an utterly unique oriental rose scent built upon a sweeping, sumptuous bouquet of warm, deep Moroccan rose absolute and lush, rich Bulgarian rose oil. Balancing both the exquisite delicacy and intense power of the rose, A Rose For opens with an exotically fresh blend of tea, incense and cassis before making way for the complexity of the floral blend. A melange of spices and woodsy notes unfolds differently on everyone, coaxing out an unpredictably beautiful blend of smooth and vibrant that surprises even as it delights. And to truly drive home the individuality, each bottle of A Rose For comes with a gold calligraphy pen, for you to add your own name to the label and make your version of this exquisite floral a special edition of one."," Darjeeling tea, incense, cassis, red rose, orris, oud, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/715025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ruby Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," 80 years ago, Nestle launched the first bar of white chocolate, bringing the number of naturally-colored chocolate in the world to 3: dark, milk, and white. But in 2017, after 13 straight years of research and development, Barry Callebaut, one of the world's most respected artisanal chocolate makers, decided that the world was ready for a fourth color – pink! Derived from a special cocoa bean, Ruby is a 100% naturally pink chocolate that possesses a uniquely sour, berry-like fruitiness not present in other types of chocolate. It was a breakthrough for the confectionary business worldwide – and for perfumery too. Bruno Acampora's Ruby is the world's first fragrance based on the scent and taste of this extraordinary pink chocolate. Please take our word for it – it's luscious. Ruby opens with sour cherries enrobed in melted dark chocolate, a hint of booze, rose, and coffee playing around the edges like a smile. Cleverly emulating the fruitiness of Ruby chocolate, the creaminess of the cocoa notes is imbued with a streak of either redcurrant or blackberry, so you get both the milky sweetness and the tongue-tickling sourness that makes pink chocolate so unique. But before you're tempted to stick your entire arm in your mouth (it's that delicious), the perfume finishes in a blaze of that earthy, semi-funky 1970's style musk for which the Acampora brand is famous. If smelling like dark chocolate, berries, and a bodaciously sexy musk is your thing (and why wouldn't it be?), then get your nose on Ruby as soon as you humanly can."," Dark chocolate, rose, red berries, pink pepper, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37539.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Percival Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Named for a mythical French thoroughbred, Percival is that rarest of wonders- a truly ageless masculine. Sure, we can picture a dashing racing horse thundering around an 18th century track to the delight of the aristocracy, but Percival is every bit as appropriate on a debonair gentleman in a pristine late-model luxury sedan, stylishly cutting his way through the bustling city night on his way to an exclusive gathering. With a subtle yet striking balance between citrus and aromatic notes, a richly masculine floral heart of lavender, violet and geranium, and a spiced, deeply woodsy base, this is the kind of scent that wears as perfectly on any man as an impeccably tailored three-piece suit- a timeless signifier of dignity and taste. Fresh, sensual and refined, Percival is bound to leave a lasting impression."," Bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiverissimo Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Vetiverissimo is Bruno Fazzolari (now creating scents under the FZOTIC label) at his most stripped-back and personal; it's the vetiver he made for himself. Calming and Zen-like, this is the vetiver you wear to relax and clear your mind. No topnotes to speak of, and no back-story either – just a superb quality vetiver dusted with a hint of warming spice, bleeding gradually into a protracted woody drydown. Wearing Vetiverissimo feels like doing a factory re-set on your nerves. With its matte, earthen dustiness and subtle spice, it smells less like a Western perfume and more like Mitti Attar, a traditional Indian distillation of clay into sandalwood oil that captures the scent of rain on red soil. A flicker of turmeric or saffron gives the earthy vetiver a little kick, but doesn't interrupt the smooth Zen flow of the scent. On paper, the rooty greenness of the vetiver seems to last forever, but on skin, it slides quickly and seamlessly into the warm embrace of polished woods, a balanced tandem of aromatic sandalwood and spicy, resinous cedar. Drying down into a smoky powder hovering between sandalwood paste and zukoh (incense powder), Vetiverissimo is a laid-back ayurvedic salve for frazzled tempers and city stress. In fact, it's so good we think it should be prescribed by doctors."," spice, vetiver, cedar, resins, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lucid Dream Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo," Lucid Dream is an olfactory exploration of the semi meditative state in which a person is aware they are asleep but is able to control their surroundings, and an ode to the potential hidden in every one of us. Juxtaposing rich, bright notes of pink pepper and davana with smoky, meditative florals and incense, Lucid Dream truly feels like another plane of existence, an ethereal journey into a world where we follow our wildest artistic impulses and break through the creative blocks that may impede our waking lives. It's a vivid, yet ethereal, experience, simultaneously romantic and contemplative, with the outstanding ingredient quality and rich tonalities for which Ex Idolo is known. Will Lucid Dream make you a master of your own subconscious? While we can't guarantee it, with a scent this wonderfully evocative, you'll certainly be inspired to find out."," Pink pepper, davana, smoky osmanthus, rose, incense, white patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flash Back In New York Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," What an interesting and original flanker! Like the fuzzy picture of a snowy New York avenue taken as its starting point, Flash Back in New York weaves rhubarb, apple, leather, and wood together so seamlessly that it's difficult to pick out the individual lines at first. But slowly, like the shape of a building or a person emerging from a blur of snowflakes, we are able to make out the earthiness of vetiver, its grey-brown smokiness illuminated in spots by the brightness of unripe fruit. If the scent begins in earth and fruit, it soon develops in a series of surprising directions that keep our interest engaged. One strand leads us off into a gently spicy tonka bean diversion, another into a smoky violet-and-saffron leather, and yet another into an aromatic woody finish. We especially love the contrast between the soft warmth of the cumin and tonka pushing against the milky coolness of the leather and papyrus. Just as in the original photo by Vivienne Gucwa, Flash Back in New York is all about the hard angles of light slicing through a fuzzy darkness. If you love either Santal 33 by Le Labo or Terre d'Hermes by Hermes but wish for a gentler, more diffuse take that's stunning on either a man or a woman, then try Flash Back in New York. Its woodsy, androgynous sexiness will appeal even to those who don't normally wear fragrance."," Cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, Tuscan leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Woody Mood Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," With Woody Mood, perfumer Betrand Duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall – crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire – compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. The inspiration for Woody Mood is Roger Steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a California redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. Since Duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (Timbuktu, Avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. Woody Mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. Aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. From the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. The contrast in Woody Mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. Like Au Coeur du Desert, Woody Mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. If you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by Olfactive Studio is a no-brainer."," bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kings Wood Fragrance Concentree,Shay & Blue," Not in the least bit like Aventus! Just putting that out there (we're aware that pineapple is a trigger word for some). No, Kings Wood takes the oft-abused pineapple and sets it among aromatic herbs and greenery for a gentlemanly English garden fougÃ¨re that's mercifully low on sugar. It's clean, aromatic, and above all, unpretentious. We love it. Although the topnote is clearly pineapple, it has a thrilling tartness that leans more on grapefruit and tart greenery than tropical cocktail. Its fougÃ¨re bone structure really comes into focus once that big, handsome oak note settles in, shoring up all the peppery herbs and fruit with its broad shoulders. Tilted towards the masculine side of the scale, Kings Wood belongs on the confident titan of industry who secretly dreams of being back in his garden, potting plants and hacking back overgrown brambles. The leather accord in the far drydown is a delightful late addition, ruffling the elegant surface of this gentlemanly fougÃ¨re with a surprisingly skanky note redolent of animal hide and undergrowth. We see Kings Wood working fantastically on a man (or woman) who loves the rustic vigor of herbs, fruit, oak, and good clean dirt but needs it packaged up into an elegant structure for a conservative setting."," pineapple, fern, Sichuan pepper, oak, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Celeste Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Does artistic talent transcend its medium? That's the question posed by Ex Nihilo's bold new Visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with Ex Nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. For the premiere of the series, they've teamed Ex Nihilo house perfumer Quentin Bisch with acclaimed photographer Mathieu Cesar, and the result is Cuir Celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality B&W print. Cuir Celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. The leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. The effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. If you love modern floral leather, don't miss Cuir Celeste- it's a work of art."," Black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
EO No. 1 EdP Eau de Parfum,Ensar Oud," When Ensar released Sultan Leather Attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. But to make an Eau de Parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. Still, the people were calling out for an EDP. And now, here we are. And what does an all-natural Ensar Oud EDP smell like? We're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr Kyaratul Mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild Hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from Sultan Qaboos's private collection. The results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding  romantic depth. There's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. A luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain Italian leather completes the vision. EDPs like this don't come around anymore- don't miss your chance to experience one."," rose, oud, leather, tobacco, tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tyrannosaurus Rex Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," A sultry heat wafts across the land, lapped up greedily by the abundant flora that thrives in its midst. Trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. The Cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. Over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. Smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex is sometimes menacing, sometimes fascinating, but never, ever ordinary."," Bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Remember Me Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," Remember Me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to Qatar that perfumer Cecile Zarokian took with Jovoy founder, Francois Henin. While in Doha, Cecile fell in love with the scent of Karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. Combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of Doha, Remember Me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents.  Combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, Remember Me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. Everything here is remarkably well balanced. The chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. In turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. You'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this – vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on – and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. But no, it's 100% unisex! Unusually, what pulls Remember Me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. Remember Me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. If you love unusual, complex ”˜sweet' fragrances such as El Born by Carner Barcelona and Leder 6 by J.F. Schwarzlose, then Remember Me might be your new obsession."," Bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Participe Passe Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Do you love balsamic, resinous fragrances? Are you addicted to the radiant warmth, the languorous sweetness, the oriental spice? Serge Lutens certainly does, with deep, stylish accords of resin and balsam present in the background of many of his most classic scents. With Le Participe Passe, the always literate Lutens looks back on the oriental scents of his past, delivering a tribute to these cornerstones of perfumery written in indulgently pure richness. Featuring a spectacular overdose of smoothly powerful Egyptian balsam, Participe Passe deploys a full complement of resins, dried fruit, leather and caramel to further soften every sharp edge, leaving you in a dreamlike state of balsamic bliss. A delicate sprinkle of spice provides subtle sophistication, but this is a balsamic scent through and through, meant for those who simply can't get enough. If that's you, we'd advise you not to hesitate- Le Participe Passe is exactly what you're searching for."," Egyptian balsam, resins, caramel, cumin, leather, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Nabataea Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at Petra, Jordan, Fredrik Dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century BC Nabataean Kingdom, for whom Petra was the capital city, back to life. A nomadic tribe by nature, Petra was a touchstone for the Nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. Santal Nabataea honors the inspiration of Petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in Petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. And wow, does it succeed. In exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, Santal Nabataea is that rare thing – a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. A pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. All the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal – the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. If it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling Santal Nabataea a priority. Featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from Australia as well as Indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal."," black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, Australian santalum album sandalwood, Indian sandalwood, coffee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51730.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tokyo Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," It's 6 am in Tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. As the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. Tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. Gallivant's Tokyo captures the moment when Old Tokyo meets New, the sweet smokiness of Japanese incense of Kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. There's a lot going on in Tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in Tokyo, the scent. But despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern Japanese urban culture. The exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. Tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. Japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. Before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. This might seem more Arabian-inspired than Japanese at first until you notice that the gentler Japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. Big city neon energy meets old world Tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect."," Yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/766007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
34 Boulevard Saint Germain EDP Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," 34 Boulevard Saint Germain, the home of the original Diptyque boutique, is as close to a royal address as it gets in niche fragrance. Still alive almost 60 years after first opening its doors, ""The Maison"" is both an ever-evolving palace of luxury, and also a timeless shrine to its own origins, a magical space lined in rich waxed blond wood, vintage cabinets stuffed with fragrant curios, and the soft, warm comfort of sunlight streaming through the large, welcoming windows. The scent inside is an unknowable mix of every perfume sprayed, every candle displayed, and every raw material played with- a wholly unique form of olfactive serendipity. It's this complete aura, both the body and soul of the boutique, captured in 34 Saint Germain Boulevard Eau de Parfum. Perfectly balancing the warm, nostalgic tones of vanilla, sandalwood and tonka against a robust, multifaceted pink pepper, this EDP feels both modern and timeless, comforting and sensual, fresh and warm. Like the wondrous shop to which it owes its name, 34 Saint Germain Boulevard EDP is sure to cast a spell on all who discover it."," Pink pepper, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483250.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hemingway Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," Masque Milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. So when they met IFF trainee Fanny Bal, apprenticing under the legendary Dominique Ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. And who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than Ernest Hemingway? With access to the full resources of the Laboratoire Monique Remy, Bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy Haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. Javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. And proprietary Vetiver Heart LMR, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance."," Ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart LMR, Haitian vetiver, Java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Viking Eau de Parfum,Creed," This fall, The House of Creed introduces the masterfully crafted Viking, a fiery men's fragrance that bottles the fearless spirit of boundless exploration for the modern man who goes against the grain. Sixth Generation Master Perfumer Olivier Creed created Viking and was inspired by the incredibly crafted longships, a centrepiece of the Viking Age and one of the greatest design feats of the ninth century. A symbol of voyage and undeniable perseverance, longships were carefully designed for the skilled seaman who embodied unbridled determination to conquer. Viking marks the brand's first major men's scent since the introduction of the cult best-selling Aventus in 2010."," Bergamot, lemon, pink peppercorn, black pepper, rose, peppermint, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, lavandin absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49375.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Geisha Botan - Eau de Parfum,Aroma M," The power of the peony in Japanese horticulture, and iconography, is overwhelming: peonies line the immaculate gardens of public parks and shrines throughout the country, not to mention their ubiquity in Japanese art from woodcutting to traditional irezumi tattooing. Now with Geisha Botan, Maria McElroy places the peony front and center, in a hypnotically pretty scent that's both youthful and sophisticated. Fresh peonies are the star, weaving their gentle honeyed lushness with a supporting dash of Bulgarian rose against a backdrop of soothing sandalwood and sensual vanilla with just a hint of animalic musk. It's a perfect floral for any occasion, casual enough to wear everyday, but with hidden depths for those who fall under its spell. Discover the quintessentially Japanese world of the peony with Geisha Botan."," Peony, rose, sandalwood, vanilla, velvet woods, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11150.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mizu Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Mizu, meaning water in Japanese, combines zesty yuzu with spearmint for an aqua seltzer opening that feels like ice water running down your spine. It's the perfect palate cleanser, especially on stupid hot days when your brain seems to stop working. Although Mizu is technically a woody-aromatic citrus, you wouldn't mistake Mizu for a French or American eau de cologne. There's something intrinsically Japanese in its transparency, delicate sourness, and complex use of herbs. Mizu smells exotic, but subtly so. Moving effortlessly from its sparkling spearmint-and-yuzu topnotes to an earthy rosewood and vetiver base, its transitions are as smooth as flowing water. In the heart, it picks up a slight spiciness from the smattering of clovey pinks (carnations) and green cardamom, but it's a subtle accent rather than a plot point. Throughout, the tone is cool and astringent, the unami-rich rosewood and aromatics devoid of anything sweet or thickening. Mizu smells all-natural, because it is all-natural, but a Japanese lightness of touch keeps it from feeling muddy. Instead, Mizu wears like moonlight - peppery, silvery, and buoyant. We're kind of obsessed with this scent here at Luckyscent, because not only does it keep us feeling refreshed on turgid afternoons, but its balance of zesty brightness and earthy sourness keeps us engaged. It's that rare thing – an easy wear that's also whip smart."," Japanese yuzu (Citrus junos), spearmint, paper pink, cardamom, rosewood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Tobacco Oud Intense Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Wonderfully soft, intriguingly smooth, the original Tobacco Oud was a soothing, yet thoroughly masculine scent that flirted with darkness, but never truly approached the edge. But sometimes, you don't want to play it safe, and Tobacco Oud Intense is more than happy to oblige, removing the training wheels from the original and amping up the spices, resins, and animalics to deliver a bolder, more daring Tobacco Oud guaranteed to turn heads and raise pulses. A sweeter, spicier vein of coriander pairs with a doubled-dose of castoreum, infusing every moment with raw, animalic magnetism that commands attention without ever turning sour, and the signature tobacco and oud combination is robustly masculine, smokier and unapologetically fiercer, while still displaying a sophisticated woodsiness. Rich and powerful, yet still tuxedo-appropriate, it's another knockout tobacco offering from Tom Ford you won't want to miss."," Coriander, tobacco, oud, labdanum, amber, sandalwood, cedar, tonka, castoreum, patchouli Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Tobacco Oud Intense by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Purple Flowers Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Housed in a stunning ""Ultra Violet""-tinted bottle (the Pantone Color of the Year 2018), Purple Flowers more than lives up to its bold presentation, delivering a rounded, vibrant, deeply woodsy floral scent that should entrance Mancera lovers and newcomers alike. Eye-popping bursts of citrus balance against a lush, rose-led floral bouquet made tantalizingly unisex by a rich, complex spice blend- pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. As it dries, the florals become sweetly ambered, weaving in woodsy and creamy tones warm enough to feel comfortable, yet still airy enough for a year-round sexiness anyone can rock in style. It's the perfect fragrance to complement the Color Of The Year: delightfully attention-grabbing at first, yet ultimately so wonderfully balanced that the hundredth time you experience it is every bit as satisfying as the first."," Mandarin, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper, elemi, fig tree, rose, patchouli, cedar, grey amber, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64935.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ruh Eau de Parfum,Pekji," Ruh, meaning spirit in Sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in Turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. Ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. And that's a rare feat. Ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. Roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the Turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. A blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. But the saffron is the real chameleon of Ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. Breathe in Ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, Turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. Yep, Ruh has soul. Luca Turin thought so too, awarding Ruh a 4 star rating in The Perfume Guide (2018)."," rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zeybek Extrait de Parfum,Pekji," Zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive Aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. The way Zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. For us, Zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. Narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3D picture of a horse stall. The central ”˜flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. This thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. Engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call Zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. The only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention."," bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odoon Extrait de Parfum,Pekji," A masterful treatise on a single material, Odoon takes us on a journey through the stored memory cells of a piece of wood, from the depths of the forest to the workshops, from sap to the burnt ashes in the grate of a fire. Odoon is wonderfully rich, balsamic, and warm – full of character and complexity despite its obsessive, almost singular focus.  The structure is remarkably uncluttered, focusing on exposing each facet of wood and turning it over for our attention. First, we smell the minty camphor of a freshly bladed log of wood, sap springing up as if startled by its sudden release. Then the roast coffee warmth of cedar, its peppery mealiness exposed to the air for the first time. Slowly, the wood dries out to the caramelic dryness of sandalwood awaiting the carver's tool, where it is polished to a high shine. It all comes together in a wisp of smoke and ash, nuggets of resin in the fine grain catching on fire here and there at the edges. Odoon is warm, deep symphony of wood notes that somehow transcends the simplicity of structure to take on a soul. If you love any of the Comme des Garcons woods-themed fragrances (Wonderwood, Sequoia, Hinoki, and so on), and want to see what a more natural, artisanal take smells like, then get yourself some Odoon."," ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Battaniye Extrait de Parfum,Pekji," Battaniye, meaning blanket in Turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. Well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. But to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. Because, although undeniably rich and comforting, Battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles – wool, leather, silk – than it does dessert.   The perfumer intended for Battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in Trabzon, a mountainous town on the Black Sea, and once an important gateway to Persia on the Spice Route. And it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario – the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. But for us, Battaniye is all about leather. A spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. It morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. Surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, Battaniye comes off as distinctly Western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. Battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding."," amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eaumer Eau de Parfum,Pekji," Eaumer, a play on the perfumer's name (O-Mer), is the tonic we'd prescribe to anyone who's ever had a bad experience with an aquatic. Forget what you know about this genre, with its overdose of Calone and potent aromachemicals – Eaumer is here to turn the concept of aquatic on its head and reconfigure all your expectations. When you wear Eaumer, the most pleasant surprise is that a scent can be naturally rather than chemically marine-fresh. Salty anise, lime, and vetiver combine to evoke the brackish freshness of a sea breeze, mercifully free of the melony sweetness common to most aquatics. The lime note sluices everything with an antiseptic brightness that will jolt you awake. The natural gasoline and rubber facets of jasmine are brought forward and accentuated, cleverly creating a petrol-on-sea-water effect that feels novel but also refreshing. When all is said and done, though, ambergris is the rock on which Eaumer is built. Redolent of minty tobacco, minerals, and sea salt, the ambergris fills the scent with a radiant freshness, but also a lingering mammalian funk. And it's this contrast between bright and murky that makes Eaumer such a pleasure to wear on a hot day."," ambergris, anise, bergamot, Haitian vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
B-612 Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's beloved children's book Le Petit Prince, the titular Prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as B-612. Traveling the universe, the Prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on B-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" So it should come as no surprise that B-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. While the result feels sophisticated and masculine, B-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. The Little Prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- B-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go."," Lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vain & Naive Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""The character of the Rose in Le Petit Prince is an extremely important one- she is the Prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the Prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. With Vain & Naive, Nishane honors the Rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. Vain & Naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. Mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. The Little Prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his Flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. One sniff of Vain & Naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place."," Bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hyouge Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," 6th century tea master Oribe Furuta fiercely adhered to the teaching of Sen Rikyu to“always be different from others” and injected a fearless and liberated sense of beauty into the world of the tea ceremony.  His Hyouge (humor) pottery, called Oribe-yaki, with its characteristic dark green and black designs, appears modern, even by today's standards.As a fragrance designed to honor both the man himself and the exquisite art to which he dedicated his life, Hyouge is a fresh, floral green tea scent with uniquely Japanese nuance.From the gently powdered green freshness of the very first moments, it's clear that Hyouge is not just a tea scent, nor even just a green tea scent- it's a matcha scent, rich yet subtle, powdery yet bright, with an evocatively complex interplay of softly bitter and sweet notes. Iris and violet further the nuance, eschewing typical floral lushness for a smooth, powdered, gently woodsy base. As you might expect, Hyouge is a quiet scent, but like a true Sado ceremony, there's not a wasted movement- each detail is a touch of perfect, deliberate beauty. Matcha lovers- your new obsession has arrived.(Note: Trademark/name of“Oribe” has changed to“Hyouge”)"," Green tea, sage, jasmine, violet, patchouli, woods, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Komorebi Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Komorebi: a Japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. It represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. Komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. In the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. There are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, Komorebi stands alone."," Mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orange X Santal Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Orange X Santal, literally orange crossed with sandalwood – simple, handsome, and to the point. A radiant composition, the scent focuses on the meeting of a remarkable bitter orange note with the authentic creaminess of santalum album grown sustainably on Australian plantations, the same species of wood that gave us the original Mysore sandalwood. Orange X Santal keeps the structure uncluttered, allowing the raw materials to speak for themselves. The orange turns from juicy pulp to aromatic rind, before settling in a salty, metallic register that feels wonderfully bracing. The aromatic bitterness of the citrus is further underlined by a chorus of dark green notes, chief among them real oakmoss, a rugged cypress, and minty basil, all of which work to lend the scent a chypric tone. The creaminess of the sandalwood in the base is exquisite, but the scent holds fast to its basic character of salty woods, moss, and orange to the end, never ceding to sweetness. Leaning masculine? Yes, we think so. There is something about its brisk, mossy bitterness of Orange X Santal that suits a man, especially if he's wearing a conservative but light summer suit."," Bitter orange, Egyptian basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, Australian santalum album",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Magnetic Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Rose Magnetic is a great example of what Essential Parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. As addictive as its name suggests, Rose Magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a Pierre Hermes Ispahan macaron.   In the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. In the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher Turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. Swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of crÃ¨me patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. A pleasure from top to toe, Rose Magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple."," Grapefruit, peppermint, Turkish rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mon Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Mon Vetiver is a surprising and non-traditional vetiver, built on a series of contrasts between bright and dark, natural and synthetic, and modern and traditional, which serve to give this scent a truly distinctive character. Balancing its essentially serious character with the cheerful radiance of woody ambers, wearing Mon Vetiver feels like wearing a Savile Row suit with the lapels turned up. The structure of Mon Vetiver is very clever. It drapes a sparkling gin and tonic accord over a dark, woody fougÃ¨re-ish base for a play of light on dark that really grabs the attention. The rugged masculinity of vetiver is not hidden away or softened, but rather emphasized by the bitterness of lime and a fistful of pungent herbs - lavender and gentian. The play between natural and synthetic is perfectly pitched here too, the earthy sweetness of natural Indonesian patchouli illuminated and fluffed out by the sweet, musky glow of cashmeran. Woody, earthy, sweet, and expansive, this is a vetiver scent with both manners and swagger."," Haitian vetiver, gin accord, Mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, Indonesian patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nice Bergamote Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Nice Bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! In fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. The juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural Calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. What's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by Mother Nature herself.  For example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. A buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. It's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. The base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from Venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. The tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. If you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then Nice Bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect."," bergamot, Jasmine Grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang ylang, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Musc Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums," Every line needs a musk, and this is The Musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. Calice Becker said she imagined this scent“as a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk”, and that's a great way to describe its effect. Wearing The Musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love.   The Musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold – it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. Applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. But copious amounts of Laotian beeswax and Australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. These notes – both fresh and warm – are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. Nirvanolide and Serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by Givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur."," Ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mysterious Oud Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff," The signature scent of the Bortnikoff house, Mysterious Oud is more than just another westernized agarwood creation- it's a wholly original creation that combines exquisite oud from all over the world (including renowned ""10k by Feel Oud"") to delight the senses and cast a deep spell of power and wisdom. Mysterious Oud greets the wearer with captivating notes of ambery citruses and ripe fruits- Bergamot and Orange spiced up with cardamom and then soaked in amber, sweet, rich, and romantic. It's the perfect introduction for a heart dominated by- no mystery here- oud, specifically a blend of beautiful, authentic oud oils supported by light, gentle and well-balanced floral note that bring out the ouds' resinous, spicy, and sweet nuances. From Thai and Vietnamese to Indian ouds, more layers are added to increase the depth of the aroma, balsamic, woody and vanillic. Some of the best oud you've ever smelled, in the service of a scent that thrillingly defies boring, ordinary oud-scent construction? This is the kind of mystery we could use more of."," Bergamot, cardamom, amber, orange, tea rose, jasmine, cinnamon, clove, myrrh, castoreum, pink pepper, nutmeg, tonka bean, oud, sandalwood, tolu balsam, opoponax, cedar, lotus, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ombre Leather Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Signature," True luxury doesn't shout. If you've been on the hunt for the perfect leather but been either smothered by an avalanche of powdery florals or slapped around the face by a Cossack's oily winter boot, then breathe a sigh of relief because“your” leather has finally arrived. Wearing Ombre Leather is like slipping into a pair of the sleekest handmade leather Oxfords in the velvety hush of a store you have to ring a bell to get into.Enigmatically rich but dry, this is a leather that sings a song of pure, smooth luxury leather, with no excess powder, fruitiness, engine oil, or plasticky saffron to ruin your enjoyment. A touch of violet leaf adds a cool, watery greenness, but overall, this is not a translucent or vegetal leather. Like the ombre effect on a luxury leather jacket, this is a scent that bleeds one note into the next, building to a successively impressive effect – black leather over purple jasmine over earth-brown patchouli over green violets over white moss. As with all truly luxurious accessories, its most impressive feat is its balance – Ombre Leather may be objectively opulent, but even more so, it's undeniably among the most fabulously comfortable leather scents we've ever encountered."," Violet leaf, cardamom, jasmine sambac, black leather, white moss, patchouli Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Ombre Leather by TOM FORD Signature Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Imitation Man,Amouage," One moment, one sensory experience, can completely alter a child's perception of the world. For Amouage Creative Director Christopher Chong, that moment happened the first time he experienced New York City as a child in the 1970's- the vibrant street culture, the breathtaking diversity, and the very sights, sounds and smells of the greatest city in the world during a tumultuous and consequential era threw open a door to life's infinite possibilities. Imitation is his attempt to capture that vibrancy. Imitation Man represents '70s NYC in bold, sensual, refined leather tones, opening with electric citrus and tingling spices that evoke blinding sunshine on bustling asphalt streets. The leather at the center of the fragrance is rich, soft suede, refined with lush rose, buttery orris and bright violet. An atmospheric base of spicy, smoky, animalic notes gives the thrilling authenticity of a smoke filled discotheque. Imitation Man will take you away to a time and place of chaos and beauty- and the endless adventures that follow."," Citron, nutmeg, black pepper, rose, orris, violet, myrrh, leather, vetiver, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41892.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kazehikaru Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Japan's northenmost territory, Hokkaido is a land of rugged natural beauty, four-season weather, and pioneer spirit, where the winds blow strong and free. It's the scents carried on that wind that inspire Kazehikaru, the native flowers and trees of Hokkaido's rocky coastlines and towering, forest-covered mountains, a collection of flora that teems with vibrant, wild beauty- a distinctly Japanese combination of refinement and energy. Tart, energizing yuzu blends seamlessly with smooth neroli, while an evocative mix of shiso leaf and lavender provide distinctive, herbaceous sensuality against a backdrop of uniquely sweet Japanese rose and woodsy, green vetiver. Beautiful and untamed, Kazehikaru glows with the spirit of Hokkaido."," Yuzu, neroli, lavender, shiso, Japanese rose, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zest Marin Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Anyone who's spend time wearing or smelling the unexpected summer hit Oud Vert Intense knows that Fragrance du Bois has a virtuosic adeptness with bright, fresh, complex fragrances. Well, Vert may need to slide over, as FdB's newest composition, Zest Marin, is every bit as lovely- the kind of eye-opening unisex that can and should be worn every single day between now and when the leaves change.   Like a day at the seaside, Zest Marin is crisp, effervescent, oceanic and fresh, with opening citrus tones of lemon and bergamot, perfectly complemented by the natural essence of galbanum. At the heart, lavandin and nutmeg bring out the best in each other in a partnership of delicious complexity, with vetiver, vanilla and woody musks providing irresistible base notes that simply make you want to plunge into the ocean of fragrance. If Fragrance du Bois gets any better at producing summer signatures, we may have to take a few months off."," Lemon, Bergamot, Galbanum.

Dent de Lait Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," We often look back on milestone events from our childhood with great poignancy, recalling the feeling of innocence and wonder, and the moment that feeling begins to change. Dent de Lait is just that, a poignant celebration one of our earliest rights of passage during that most magical period of our lives. The loss of one's baby teeth serves as a metaphor for and a harbinger of the inevitable march toward adolescence, and this fragrance captures it with great aplomb. A flash of metallic zing opens bracingly, conjuring the slightly metallic flavor of the void where a baby tooth once roosted. The quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way to a creamy-soft and reassuring smoothness through the deft use of almond milk, coconut and floral aldehydes, transporting you to that moment just before you began to trade your innocence for wisdom.Creamy, smooth and ultimately reassuring, this gourmand is imbued with a sense of cloistered security, connecting us to that comforting feeling we enjoyed when we were young."," Almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36161.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cap Neroli Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," One of the most memorable aspects of the thoroughly gorgeous Cote d'Azur is the ubiquitous presence of orange trees, splashing the landscape with vivid color and perfuming the air with their beautiful scent. From a single tree, aromas of bright citrus, fresh woods, and smooth, creamy flowers float on the breeze, and when it comes to harvesting scented ingredients for perfumery, the versatility becomes astounding- one humble tree produces everything from bitter, spicy petitgrain to enchantingly smooth orange blossom absolute. Cap Neroli features every aspect of the Cote d'Azur's fabled orange trees, opening with a contrast of bitter petitgrain and sweet mandarin given a fresh aquatic shimmer via rosemary and mint. A heart of bright neroli and soft orange flower is enhanced with sweet ylang and fresh jasmine, all resting on a bed of fresh musks and oakmoss that linger for hours. It's a perfect tribute to a place of staggering beauty, and the ideal summer scent for just about anyone looking to bring a bit of the French Riviera with them wherever they go."," Petitgrain, orange, mandarin, rosemary, mint, neroli, ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313058.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere d'Argent Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," FougÃ¨re d'Argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougÃ¨re, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. With oakmoss no longer available, Tom Ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with Akigalawood, a Givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. What emerges from Ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine – earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. If there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably FougÃ¨re d'Argent. The aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal Savile Row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. Akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. What marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. Whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. Fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from Gris Clair to Tom Ford's own Fucking Fabulous will likely love FougÃ¨re d'Argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. Dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, FougÃ¨re d'Argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing."," mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, Akigalawood, coumarin Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Fougere d'Argent by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Live In Colors Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," The perfect citrus is an elusive thing. Pretty much the Holy Grail of perfumery, in fact. Citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. We're happy to report that Live in Colors pulls it off. It sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. In other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat.  The fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. It smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. The scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. There's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. In the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. Live in Colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. It's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. But a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us – it just needs to smell fresh and natural. And in that respect, Live in Colors scores a perfect 10."," Lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Just Before Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Just Before revolves around Palo Santo, the so-called“Holy Wood” burned by the Incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. The wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. It smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of Palo Santo incense – smoky, but with a lively sparkle.  A rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. The contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the Hypnotic Poison model. But what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. Redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmand“patisserie” elements. Delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, Just Before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. But because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. Sugar and spice and all things nice....Just Before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76423.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Don't Know What Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Among the first things aspiring perfumers learn is that the most important ingredients in the construction of a scent are the invisible ones- the aromachemicals and extremely subtle naturals that don't stand out to the nose, but nevertheless add crucial space, depth and structure to the fragrance. Even the finest floral extracts or precious woods depend on this structure to avoid feeling flattened-out, condensed or overpowering, but to the casual fragrance fan, the contributions of these delicate ""spacing"" notes goes completely unappreciated- until now. I Don't Know What is a minimalist scent in the compelling tradition of Escentric Molecules, able to be worn alone as a sheer, ethereal hint of citrus, musks and woods, but designed to layer beneath any scent you can imagine- fragrance oils, other perfumes, a favorite extract- boosting power, adding radiance, and generally enhancing absolutely anything it touches. We should all be so lucky!"," Bergamot essence, iso e super, vetiver acetate, civettone, firsantol, ambrox super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68628.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rehab Extrait de Parfum,Initio Parfums," What is the scent of compulsion? The fragrance that represents the deepest yearning, desire for which there is no solution but to give in? We'd find it hard to top Rehab, a sweet-yet-smoky stunner possessed of an almost primally compelling magnetism. The perfection lies in the sophisticated simplicity of the compostion- rich, sophisticated lavender and smoothly spiced tobacco set a vibrant yet refined tone, masculine-leaning but drop-dead sexy on just about anybody. As Rehab dries, smoky, creamy patchouli and vanilla create a warmly ambered aura that lingers for hours. We can't tell you how to use the dangerously seductive power at your fingertips- but you've been warned."," Bergamot, lavender, tobacco, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, sandalwood, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blessed Baraka Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," Absolutely captivating, Blessed Baraka weaves a blend of musks, woods and rich amber around the wearer to create a palpable sense of divine energy that instantly commands the room. At the center is a beautiful specimen of sandalwood, at once excitingly vivid and compellingly creamy, given sharp definition and a sensual edge via a  cascade of musks. A powerful amber hums as the fragrance dries, bittersweet and addictive, transporting body and soul to a higher plane of existence.

Psychedelic Love Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums," Psychedelic Love is a highly addictive fragrance, with its creamy, powdery and floral facets, wavering between vanilla, almond and heliotrope, a combination that will drive you obsessively into addiction. This is sheer, giddy, indulgent delight, the florals melding sweet ylang, powdered heliotrope, and luscious Bulgarian rose with an impossibly smooth myrrh and creamy, mouthwatering vanilla. A base of robust yet smooth patchouli keeps things trippy- but something this sexy means you won't be traveling alone."," Bergamot, ylang-ylang, Bulgarian rose, heliotrope, myrrh, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Grev Extrait de Parfum,Slumberhouse," Slumberhouse simply does not produce ordinary, standard scents- something absolutely necessary to keep in mind when describing Grev. Is it a fougere? Sure, the definition might roughly fit, but leave your expectations of unchallenging freshness aside. What it really is, is a transparent metallic/herbal accord of star anise, crisp apple peel, spearmint leaf, ocean pine and bergamot twisted into hollowed tunnels padded in turquoise hues, dusted in sweet mossy mineral powder and blanketed with copaiba resin and sandalwood oil. Ordinary left the building a long time ago."," Copaiba balsam, spearmint, pine, star anise, apple peel, fir resin, clove, orris root, cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/631012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Humanity is connected to the earth and minerals through hints of moss.

Crepuscule des Ames Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Crepuscule refers to the moments of transition from light to darkness, and from dark to light. The sleepy, dusky hours and the brilliance of dawn and new beginnings. Crepuscule des Ames is the twilight of souls and a perfume to captivate the senses with fine spices and a warm golden glow. A second skin to wear in the dusky house while the souls are at play, when we feel deep desires and the duality inherent in our consciousness.

Gold Incense Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Some incense fragrances are quiet and spiritual, while others are sultry and seductive. But when was the last time you experienced an incense fragrance that was lush, floral and opulent? Introducing Gold Incense, a seductively exuberant, downright juicy floral incense that hums with light, life and happiness. By blending ripe, fruity mandarin with luscious rose, the rich vein of incense running through the center of Gold Incense is never dry or austere, but rather compellingly robust, playing off of spice-forward notes of coffee and pink pepper and smooth, rich patchouli and sandalwood to create an enveloping, three-dimensional composition. Maybe not everything that glitters is gold- but this stunningly robust, romantic take on incense could be nothing else."," Incense, pink pepper, mandarin, bergamot, coffee, violet, rose, jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Rugged, imposing, and central to military history both ancient and modern, the Hindu Kush mountain range in Central Asia is a formidable sight indeed. It's a border not merely between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but between heaven and earth itself. To honor this wild location, Mancera presents a uniquely resinous scent, rich with spice and incense, perfect for the adventurous spirit in all of us. Hindu Kush opens with a sweet and complex layer of exotic spice, with prominent notes of saffron and clove reinforced with the energy of black pepper and the earthy resinousness of another famed export of the region- a cannabis essential oil harvested from authentic Afghan-grown plants. Oud, patchouli and woods dominate the heart, but their heaviest and darkest tones are played down, keeping the robust spiciness at the center of the composition. A vanilla and musk base works along the same concept, reinforcing the resins and spices without drowning them in overly rich or earthy tones and presenting Hindu Kush as that rarest of oriental fragrances- one with more subtlety than opulence. And as a result, it's hard to think of a human being alive that wouldn't smell unbelievable wearing it."," Saffron, cumin, cloves, black pepper, labdanum, davana, cannabis, agarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, white musk, gaiac, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

With well above average projection and longevity, Wild Python will spend hours curling itself around you, its power on full display. How you choose to use it is up to you."," Tuberose, osmanthus, peach, bergamot, jasmine, orange blossom, patchouli, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64934.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hyrax Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Climbing to its perch in the morning sky, the African sun reaches across a mountain range to caress a wide, flat boulder, baking it to a gentle heat. From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.At the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery –– African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature. This unique perfume skillfully blends saffron, pink pepper, whiskey, rose and musks to invoke an abstract image of a dusty African mountainscape. Like the nimble hyraxes that spill from hillside crevices in search of the sun upon their musky hides, this scent will weave its way into your senses with a light but primal touch."," Blackberry, elemi, pink pepper, saffron, Turkish rose, African Stone, hyacinth, styrax, whiskey, amber, benzoin, musks, patchouli, sandalwood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Dore Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," Fine fragrance has a stunning ability to represent myth and poetry in vivid reality- to make the conceptual come to olfactive life. In Bois Dore, Fabrice Pellegrin envisions a fantastical Golden Wood, glowing with rich woods, delectable spice and smooth tonka bean. While the core of the scent is undeniably the interplay between the velvety, robust wood notes and a powdered, vanilla-inflected tonka bean, the beauty of Bois Dore manifests itself in its remarkable versatility- fans of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Penhaligon's Roaring Radcliff will find that a supporting note of tobacco imbues a familiar strain of regal, masculine texture, while the powderiness of the tonka and a distinctly sweet almond maintain a warm, feminine sensuality. And no matter your persuasions, a long-lasting tingle of black pepper and a salty mineralic note provide a unique and energizing sparkle. While not every fragrance lives up to its concept, we're thrilled to report that Bois Dore is every bit the luminous, fantastical Golden Wood we were promised."," Black pepper, mineral notes, cedar, vanilla, tobacco, almond, tonka, musk, teak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Pikovaya Dama Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," A celebration of the Golden Era of Russian literature, Pikovaya Dama ""Queen of Spades"", named for the famed Pushkin story, is a glamorously vintage, unapologetically opulent emissary from bygone glory days. Blending sharp, vibrant citrus with a richly, unabashedly powdered romantic floral heart, atop a sensual base of musks, woods and vanillas. But in reality, describing the individual notes feels incomplete somehow, as the real achievement of Pikovaya Dama is a sumptuously blended, wholly pervasive atmosphere of vintage grandeur, where the pillow-soft powder, luscious florals and deep musky base all exist simultaneously, exuding a soulfully resonant aura that only strengthens as it wears. Extravagant, beautiful and unique- Pikovaya Dama is a rare treasure indeed."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, neroli, coriander, atlas cedar, orris, incense, nutmeg, patchouli, sandalwood, musk, bourbon vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51148.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," The oriental, reinvented. When Fragrance du Bois set their sights on amber as a main component for their newest Prive release, our expectations- and imaginations- were sky high. After all, the Prive line is defined by exceedingly rare ingredients, including their proprietary 100% organic vintage oud, as well as a willingness to simultaneously embrace and defy convention, to deliver scents that knew when to follow traditional structure, and when to take bold risks. To that end, Amber Intense is certainly an amber scent- loaded with rich, resinous, balsamic fullness- but with its spicy, floral complexity, it's also so much more. Amber Intense opens with a spice and citrus laden burst, where notes of bergamot, tangerine, black pepper and cinnamon pop and fizz with vibrant energy. As the rich floral heart unfolds, an exquisite blend of rose, jasmine and neroli captives against the rich amber accord, a warmly resinous blend of styrax, labdanum and patchouli that doubles down with enduring base notes of benzoin and peru balsam alongside Fragrance du Bois' unparalleled vintage oud. The result is a scent that's rich but never heavy, complex but never confusing, with an undeniably confident elegance. Whether you approach Amber Intense from the perspective of an amber lover or that of a connoisseur of spicy orientals, you're sure to find your new signature scent."," Bergamot, tangerine, orange, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, saffron, neroli, rose, jasmine, blackcurrant, patchouli, styrax, cistus, benzoin, peru balsam, musk, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75723.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moth Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes. At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and dark, inky florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame."," Black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unsettled Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Since when does the end of the world smell so pleasant? It's a fair question if your first exposure to Unsettled was the hand-blown flacon originally commissioned by the Nevada Museum of Art: an atomic blast shaped container that literally glowed green from the uranium glass used to craft it. So it's something of a surprise that the scent itself is downright happy- a fresh, creamy sandalwood brightened even more with mouthwatering pineapple and smooth black tea. The result is a wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent that feels like a day on the beach- smooth, easy to wear, and almost hypnotically relaxing. It's the kind of fragrance that would make an effortless signature- it's hard to imagine a circumstance or person it wouldn't smell amazing on. It's Bruno's clever way of juxtaposing the occasionally- but consequentially- overlapping histories of Nevada and the South Pacific. No, your bottle won't be made of uranium glass- we're pretty sure that wouldn't be a big hit with our shippers- but one spritz and you won't be worried about a thing."," Bergamot, china black tea, clary sage, pineapple, caledonian sandalwood, labdanum, vanilla, ocean breezes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69311.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Viper Green Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," There's something inherently dangerous about green scents. Yes, they're fresh and vibrant, but lurking behind that freshness is a sense of wildness, of instinctual, uncontrollable nature. This dangerous, seductive side of green is what gives us Viper Green, a new unisex floral from Ex Nihilo that feels thrillingly, poisonously sexy. Opening with a flash of bright green mandarin backed up with crisp angelica and bitingly fresh galbanum, we can tell from the very start that this is really and truly a green scent, thorns and all. A floral heart of iris adds dry, cool elegance, while spiky vetiver and deep, earthy patchouli are rich and imposing with primordial power. To wear Viper Green is to feel like a hunter, imbued with predatory grace, fully in tune with nature. Make sure you pack it for your next hunt."," Green mandarin, angelica, galbanum, iris, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Cologne,Les Bains Guerbois," A fiery, subversive, take-no-prisoners interpretation of the classic formula, Les Bains Guerbois EDC is no ordinary eau de cologne. Eschewing the familiarity of a citrus top, this EDC opens with a sensuously spicy mix of ginger and cardamom, igniting the senses before leading into a rich, woodsy heart of cedar and patchouli balanced against a smooth, mystical papyrus. The base is no less captivating, as sweet musk and warm amber intertwine with smoky, sacred frankincense for an eau de cologne of unparalleled depth and sophistication. Invigorating and seductive, this unique eau de cologne is the perfect scent for the boldly adventurous, the cheekily controversial, and anyone looking to break out from the monotony of the mainstream."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, musk, amber, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1885 Bains Sulfureux Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," While the legendary Bains Guerbois has undergone many transformations in its 133 years of life, it began as a temple of beauty and well-being, a renowned spa and bathhouse that played host to Belle Epoque luminaries from Renoir to Proust. 1885 Bains Sulfureux is an evocation of those early glory days, when an open door would release the aromas of thousands of essences of plants, herbs and flowers, carried on the warm steam of those legendary Turkish and Russian baths. After opening with invigorating top notes of juicy mandarin and bergamot, alongside herbaceous rosemary and blackcurrant leaf, a fresh floral heart of orange blossom and jasmine feels as soothingly lush as an infused soaking tub. And a complex, never heavy base of therapeutic essences including tonka, tolu, benzoin and incense enchant and delight, healing the spirit and empowering the body. Refreshing, romantic and complex, 1885 is a magical journey through time and space."," Bergamot, rosemary, blackcurrant, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, tolu balsam, benzoin, cashmere wood, incense, tonka, sandalwood, labdanum, patchouli, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1978 Les Bains Douches Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," Paris, 1978- a legendary spa has evolved into one of the world's wildest nightclubs, and you have exclusive access. Your endless night begins in a joyful haze of noise, liquor and laughter- the signature bitter orange of a negroni for your date, and a whiskey infused with clary sage for you- boozy, bright and aromatic. A rush of gorgeous florals waft from the beautiful club-goers as you make your way through sensuous tendrils of tobacco smoke, towards the majestic cedarwood bar. On the dance floor, the exotic gyrations of thousands of beautiful people recall rich, seductive tones of myrrh, vanilla, and patchouli- the Bains Douches is but another waypoint in time and space connected to the revelries of bygone eras, and those yet to come. Rich, intoxicating and exciting, this is the smell of pure, hedonistic pleasure- and we can't get enough."," Yuzu, bitter orange, whiskey, davana, clary sage, rose, heliotrope, blond tobacco, myrrh, mate, amber, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2013 Residence d'Artistes Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," For a brief moment before it was transformed into a boutique luxury hotel, the Les Bains space was given a unique form of rehabilitation- Paris' most accomplished and admired street artists were moved in to live there for several weeks, with the freedom to pursue whatever artistic goals they desired. This spiritual cleansing is commemorated with 2013 Residence d'Artistes, a beautifully fruity, woodsy, and floral scent that explodes with color and inspiration. Juicy peach and mandarin collide with lush violet and jasmine, mouthwatering cumin and cardamom, all against a backdrop of warm, musky leather. Like the short but amazing moment in the grand history of Les Bains that inspired it, this is an ode to creativity- the spontaneity, the serendipity, and ultimately, the memory that lingers in the aftermath."," Cardamom, mandarin, bergamot, peach, jasmine, papyrus, violet, cumin, musk, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2015 Le Phenix Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," ""In Paris, nothing disappears, and everything can come back to life.""It's with this sentiment that the legendary Les Bains once again steps out onto the scene. Having lived as a beloved spa and gathering house, then a world-famous party spot, then a luminary artists' retreat, its newest incarnation is a fusion of them all- a boutique hotel, a spa, a club, a waypoint. The full history of this magical locale is laid out in Le Phenix, with the rich scent of a majestic firebird rising from old ashes- fiery ginger and cardamom set the scene, while a smooth cedarwood heart projects strength, integrity, and tradition. Most of all, a bright, rich incense permeates throughout the fragrance, exuding ethereal beauty, timeless power, and warm spirituality. When you wear Le Phenix, you look forwards and backwards simultaneously, reverent towards the history of this grand place, but charging forwards in pursuit of new adventure and achievement. Le Phenix is a scent for those in perfect harmony with the eternal pleasures and rewards of the City of Light."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, incense, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gelsomini di Capri Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," As is customary in the tradition of Carthusia  Gelsomini's beginnings originate from a legend which tells of Carthusians. Its origins come from kings and and queens, but above all, from flowers, the most beautiful in Capri.  Among these are delicate jasmine which, as if by magic, evoke the charm of a unique island in the bouquet of its new fragrance. Delicate sweet fruity notes are brought together in an intriguing fragrance which is fresh but persistent. Jasmine and Egyptian geranium combine with clove and ylang while the intoxicating cedar and zagara climax into the musky amber notes of bees wax and Madagascar Vanilla. One of a kind and only from Capri."," Jasmine, geranium, cloves,  ylang-ylang, orange blossom, cedar, beeswax, Turkish rose, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52920.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavish Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," A clean and fresh stunner with the typical sense of excitement and attitude that one has come to expect from Boadicea the Victorious. Uplifting and buoyant from the beginning. Bergamot dashed with lemon gives a sense of hope and expectation. The heart is bright and optimistic, orange flower meeting with decadent rose, peppered delightfully with nutmeg. The base is warm, yet soft, and full of rapturous joy."," Bergamot, lemon, orange flower, rose, pepper, nutmeg, sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, vetiver, moss, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48535.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hallucinogenic Pearl Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," While no serious fragrance enthusiast would ever question the luxuriousness of orris butter- the rich, earthy-creamy depth, the papyrus-like smoothness- it's fair to ask a simpler question: is it any fun? Alas, such sophistication sometimes comes at a cost, which is often freshness, light, or spontaneity. Perhaps that's why we love Hallucinogenic Pearl so much- preternaturally light-on-its-feet, it's an orris-based stunner that deploys fresh musks and smooth leather to conjure up a higher, happier plane of existence where orris is not only sophisticated, but sparkling. Awash in vintage radiance, we feel warmth, light, and deeply sexy leather smoothness all flowing together, so comforting and seductive that it's no effort at all to surrender to its power and slip into the cosmic groove."," Ambrette, bergamot, pink pepper, violet, orris, iriseine, suede, blonde woods, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56717.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fior Fiore Eau de Parfum,Eau d'Italie," The iconic image of the Hotel Le Sirenuse, the inspiration behind Eau d'Italie, is from the outside- who could forget the gorgeous cliffs and sparkling blue water of the Amalfi Coast? But the man-made elements of the hotel are every bit as magical- case in point, the grand, dreamlike Champagne Bar, which winds from beautifully contoured interior out onto an enchanting terrace replete with charming mosaic work and a variety of night-blooming jasmine plants, who release their intoxicating scent into the warm evening air, creamy, fresh and seductive. This is the inspiration behind Fior Fiore, summer nights on the terrace, surrounded by flowers, the day's sun a faint glow beyond the horizon. Lush lily of the valley intertwines with a gentle but deeply romantic jasmine, all supported with a fresh, comforting ambrette musk. It's a beautiful memory, hazy and candlelit, tipsy on champagne and warmly sensual, a taste of Positano evenings you can take home with you all year round."," Lily of the valley, jasmine petals, jasmin sambac, ambrette.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43235.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terra Mia Eau de Parfum,Carthusia," Carthusia has long held a well-earned reputation for their ability to capture the olfactory beauty of the Italian landscape- azure sea, juicy citrus, wild aromatic vegetation, and shining sun. But Terra Mia, a rare Carthusia gourmand, seems more inspired by the simple joys of traditional Italian life and culture- gatherings in the village square, puppet shows, fresh flowers in the market, and steaming cups of espresso. So while it opens with wonderful freshness- tart bergamot, bright pink pepper- the grand players here are warmer, deeper notes- mouthwatering hazelnut, sweet orange blossom, lush rose, and robust coffee, all set against a resinously ambered wood base both rich and soothing. As with all Carthusia scents, we feel transported, but this time we're in an ancient piazza full of life and laughter, an espresso in hand, joy in our hearts. We might not have grown up in Italy, but one sniff of Terra Mia and you'll agree- it feels like home."," Bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52919.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nudiflorum Extrait de Parfum,Nasomatto," Natural. Primitive. Sensual. These are the words that Nasomatto chooses to provide, instead of a notes list, to represent Nudiflorum. One sniff and you'll see why any notes would ultimately feel inadequate- of course, it's driven by florals as the name might suggest, but these are bold, impressionistic, and shockingly intimate florals- brighter, lusher and more vivid than a straight-up reproduction, with a compellingly skinlike musk surrounding them, at times innocent and youthful, at others carnal, animalic and deeply seductive, eventually gaining a smoky and woodsy edge with which Nasomatto fans will be well acquainted. It's olfactory intimacy, the kind of scent you must experience to understand its raw power and seductive tranquility. Most simply put, Nudiflorum is the kind of sensual fragrance that only Nasomatto could ever produce.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Erawan Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Erawan is the scent of late summer tipping into fall. It is the smell of the harvest, with fields of aromatic barley, hay, and oats waiting to be brought in, the earthy goodness of nuts, flour, and honey stacked high in the larder, and the wholesome, leaf-brownness of tobacco leaves drying on barn floors. It is not an uncommon theme in indie perfumery, but Erawan stands proud of other examples by way of two things. First, Dusita's sophisticated style of making perfumes puts a high-definition gloss on the rustic theme, making it the perfect choice for a young Paris or New York sophisticate who wants real, but who also wants polished. Second, whereas most fragrances with a countryside bent are loaded with syrupy sweetness, booze, or fruit, Erawan boasts only the gentle sweetness of nuts, hay, and herbs, thus making it an airy, elegant wear. A series of little contrasts has been cleverly worked into the composition to give the scent texture and movement. There is the herbal brightness of clary sage and petigrain up top, but also a nutty, creamy undercurrent of vetiver to provide depth. Liatris, or deertongue, a plant extract that lends perfumes a coumarin-like tone, gives off the scent of freshly-toasted tobacco leaf, but its dry resinousness is nicely offset by the damp, fresh greenery of a surprising muguet note planted in the center. The inky bitterness of oakmoss is suggestive of long shadows under oak trees, but a judicious dose of vanilla softens everything into a delicious, late-afternoon blur. Erawan wears like a ray of sunshine on your face. Both beautiful and unusual, its rustic charm does not come at the cost of sophistication."," herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, Haitian vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur de Lalita Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Fleur de Lalita is a bouquet of tropical flowers that has grown up, moved to France, and taken up smoking and reading Baudelaire. Peel back the layers and you'll see that its core of lush ylang ylang, tropical lilies, and magnolia remains intact. But bookended by a smoky galbanum up top and salty, lived-in ambergris down below, Fleur de Lalita is definitely a floral for adults. The playoff between milky sweetness of tropical flowers and the smoky, salty galbanum-ambergris tandem is what makes Fleur de Lalita such a tour de force. The innocent side of Fleur de Lalita shows its face first, with a cluster of jasmine, magnolia, and lily so wet and crisp it might have been cut from the garden just moments before. Curlicues of buttery ylang ylang snake around the white petals as you bury your face in this bouquet, releasing a steamy tropical undercurrent. But the damp lushness of the flowers is almost immediately cut by a waft of galbanum, a green resin whose smell is pitched halfway between freshly-cut plant stems and smoke. The effect is of being in a tropical garden while someone is smoking an illicit cigarette in a nearby ylang bush, the smoke mingling gently with the creamy flowers. A dash of resinous sandalwood gives the florals and greenery a handsome backbone. But the real payoff comes in the base, when musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris to form a sweet and salty skin-like nuance that will send you over the top. The combination of creamy florals, crisp greenery, smoke, and salty musks in Fleur de Lalita is simply stunning. This is the fragrance that will make you feel like the best version of yourself, every day of your life."," Rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moscow Mule Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Crisp, potent and energizing- a Moscow Mule, that electric combination of premium vodka, fresh lime, and fiery ginger beer, served in an ice-cold copper mug, might just be the perfect summer refreshment. It's only appropriate that this simple, perfect formula is the inspiration for the latest from Romano Ricci and Juliette Has A Gun, a house that's always excelled at finding the complexity in minimalism. And what a knockout Moscow Mule is- blending bright, tart bergamot with a wonderfully spicy ginger note for an intoxicating kick from the very first sniff. In the background, a subtly powerful base of Norlimbanol- a Firmenich molecule known for dry woodsiness and a sexy hint of animalic amber- ensures rich longevity without sacrificing an ounce of freshness. Is Moscow Mule a simple scent? Absolutely. But in that simplicity is a stunning- and wonderfully easy to wear- cocktail perfect for literally any occasion. Sidle up to the bar and order yourself a Moscow Mule- who knows where your night will take you?"," Bergamot, ginger, woody notes (norlimbanol)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fantastic Oud Eau de Parfum,Montale," What is the true identity of oud? While the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence. This is at the core of Fantastic Oud, in many ways a culmination of Montale's illustrious work with the material, a sumptuous feast for the senses. This rich, nuanced and warm fragrance reveals notes of rose, patchouli, tobacco, incense and styrax that merge with the voluptuous notes of leather, sandalwood and ambergris revealing the rawest character of oud. In other words, it's every facet of oud, masterfully blended together to offer something for everyone in a hypnotically smooth, spicy, rich, warm, fresh, lush, seductive package. Whether you're a newcomer to Montale's ouds or you own them all, you're sure to fall in love with Fantastic Oud."," Incense, styrax, tobacco, oud, rose, patchouli, leather, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orris Tattoo Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Orris Tattoo pays tribute to one of perfumery's most incredible raw materials – orris root. While florists adore the delicate, arching flowers and tall green stems of the iris, perfumers are far more interested in the unprepossessing-looking root underneath. The process of making orris butter is a real labor of love. The iris roots, or rhizomes as they are known, are left to grow underground for three years, and then left to dry out in a cool storeroom for another three years. The result is the most expensive butter you will never find on any supermarket shelf – a silvery substance that Chandler Burr once referred to as“liquid good taste”. Like pure orris butter itself, Orris Tattoo smells like the ground and the sky all bound together in one smell. To wit, it smells like bread, violets, eau de vie, suede shoes, cold air, and silky earth. Rooty and somewhat fresh at fresh, the scent soon develops a putty-like texture that remains cool to the touch, like chilled butter taken from a florist's fridge. The orris here feels very pure, but it won't make you feel like you're chomping on raw carrots – its purity is gentle, wrapped in a cashmere blanket. This purity is sustained right through to the supple grey suede that develops in the lower registers of the scent. With a material as exquisite as orris root, we pleased to see that Orris Tattoo resists the temptation to add on too many bells and whistles – apart from a touch of what feels like humid, coconutty sandalwood, cashmere woods, and a hint of violets or heliotrope, this fragrance never really deviates from the orris root hymn sheet. So, if you're looking for the doughy but ethereal pleasures of pure orris, then put Orris Tattoo on your test list stat.", Orris root,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76709.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre Mojo Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 1917, there was a new shape in the air when Coty launched its now legendary Chypre de Coty. Putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. In the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like Mitsouko, Tabac Blond, and Pour Monsieur. Of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). In this post-IFRA age, and 100 years on from the launch of Chypre de Coty, Parle-Moi de Parfum suggests that Chypre Mojo is what a chypre now looks like. Despite the absence of oakmoss, Chypre Mojo rolls in with all the presence of a proper“old skool” perfume. Its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. A bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. Chypre Mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. While the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. Confident, modern, and ebullient, Chypre Mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo."," Bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Heritage Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but Heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when European high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. Truly a haute couture scent, Heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. Heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. A complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. Taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. Sure, we'll never get to live in Paris as it was in the Belle Epoque, but with Heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be."," Bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure organic vintage oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Benjoin Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," Upon application, Vanille Benjoin immediately envelops its wearer in a soft, protective cocoon of vanilla that we find insanely comforting. It's a hug in a bottle. The perfumer, an island native herself, helped the brand to source two types of very special vanilla for this scent – the first, a soft, floral Tahitian vanilla, and the second, a resinous Madagascaran vanilla. The vanillas add a toasty warmth to the scent, as well as a delicious“roundness”, but it's worth noting that there's nothing sugary or heavy about Vanille Benjoin. The vanilla here is dry and woody, tending towards the savory end of the spectrum rather than the sweet.The salty diffusiveness of ambroxan certainly helps to control sweetness, but the main hand in ensuring the scent remains dry is the Siam benzoin, the basenote material chosen here to be“married” to the vanilla. Although benzoin is roughly analogous to vanilla in that they both add a warm, sweet“fullness” to the basenotes of a scent, benzoin differs substantially by being far more medicinal, resinous, and spicy-peppery in character. In Vanille Benjoin, the fiery cinnamon topnotes of benzoin are cleverly matched, step for step, by cedarwood, a material possessed of a similarly spicy, balsamic underbite. In an equally smart move, the doughy, clay-like properties of benzoin are drawn out by a judicious application of tonka bean absolute, which shares with benzoin a buttery texture and nutty aftertaste. Vanille Benjoin resolves itself in a delicious vanilla suede accord that signals pure luxury and comfort, without any of attendant stodge - powdered sugar diffused in the crisp, cold air of a winter's morning."," Tahitian vanilla absolute, Madagascan vanilla absolute, Siamese benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Basmati Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," The deeply fragrant aroma of Basmati rice is one of the best smells in the world, and frankly, we're a little surprised it doesn't turn up in more perfumes. In Santal Basmati, perfumer Alexandra Carlin, taking her cue from founder Sophie Broneau's passion for basenotes, cleverly pairs the scent of cooked rice to the most precious and fragrant of woods: Mysore sandalwood (s. album), grown sustainably in Kerala. Why clever? Well, you'll notice that basmati rice has a lot in common with sandalwood – they share a certain creaminess, as well as a steamy, nutty undertone akin to grains toasted in butter and cooked long and slow in milk. Santal Basmati simply identifies the facets they have in common, unites them, and serves us up a bowl of pure bliss. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, given all these milky, woody notes, Santal Basmati is a rather heavy concoction – but it's really not. A remarkable sleight of hand injects the composition with an airiness that ensures that, while certainly comforting and warming, the scent wears as lightly as a silk cardigan. The sweetness level is nicely judged too, with a buttered popcorn nuance adding a hint of salt, and a supporting framework of woods that stops the scent tipping over completely into rice pudding territory. If you love the triple crÃ¨me comfort factor of woody gourmands such as Santal Majuscule (Serge Lutens), Palo Santo (Carner Barcelona), or PralinÃ© de Santal (Pierre Guillaume), then let us tell you straight: you need some Santal Basmati in your life."," Mysore sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cedre Iris Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," Cedre Iris is that rare bird – a 100% equal partnership between delicate iris pallida and a material that would normally eat it for breakfast, namely a tough, resinous cedarwood. Well, three types of cedarwood, to be exact, the combination of which gives the composition a complex woody profile that darts between smoky, leathery, balsamic, and spicy. But in Cedre Iris, the tension between the heavy cedarwood and the ephemeral orris is held tight, allowing the cool, waxen orris to float serenely over the very material that would normally subsume it. The payoff of this impressive balancing act is a fragrance that highlights both the exquisitely powdery sheen of iris and the spicy thickness of cedar. Iris pallida from Florence, which costs $60,000 per kilo, has been used in significant quantities here, so you really feel its presence. But Iris Cedre is not a monolith. The iris and cedarwood star, for sure, but in time, you will notice that they are supported by elements that cast their own shadows. Particularly noticeable is the cinnamon-dusted benzoin that sands down the cedar and orris into a soft blur of incensey, vanillic powder, for dramatic scent trail that's sure to turn heads. But myrrh also plays a significant role here, lending the drydown in particular a crepuscular, almost fungal earthiness that serves to highlight the pale dustiness of the iris. Wax, butter, silver, earth, incense, and polished woods – Iris Cedre truly is the last word in tailored elegance."," Cedar (Moroccan Atlas, Texas, Virginia), Florentine iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Oud Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," Tom Waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car"" – and Patchouli Oud by perfumer Nicolas Bonneville has much the same quality. Earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of Indonesian and Javan jungles, Patchouli Oud is a study in brown. Many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but Patchouli Oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. The oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. As with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. The smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms Patchouli Oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit."," Oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc Ambre Gris Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," Ambergris, the precious sperm whale excretion that's aged for years by the ocean, is the purest essence of the sea. It's an unusual material in perfumery because although it derives from an animal and retains a distinctly animalic character, it also smells mineral, earthy, ozonic, and foresty. In fact, one could say that the scent of ambergris is a microcosm of nature's bounty in full. Ambergris is something of a shapeshifter in perfumery, though – it's suggestible. In Musc Ambre Gris, the perfumer has nudged the natural ambergris towards a saltier, woodsier interpretation than some of the sweeter, more amber-focused compositions in the genre. What's striking about this fragrance is that it smells completely organic, as if it were ripped from nature and not made in a lab. It encompasses all the wind-chafed aromas of a desolate beach in winter, ranging from desiccated driftwood, crushed seashells, and minerals to the inky bitterness of marine lichen. Musc Ambre Gris smells vivid and wild, its smoky tangle of sea grasses (vetiver), yerba mate, and sharp black musk with its creosote-like tang all pulling together to emphasize the raspy, masculine-leaning character of the scent. In the far drydown, earthy patchouli and white truffle add a fungal depth that accentuates the salt-flat brininess of the ambergris. A perfume of scorched earth, Musc Ambre Gris has the brooding intensity of a young Brando- not to mention the undeniable seductiveness."," Amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Curcuma Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris," The first fragrance in the world to use natural extract of turmeric, Cuir Curcuma is a strikingly different kind of leather fragrance. Neither a Russian nor a Spanish (Moorish) leather, but rather, an Indian leather, it rises like a phoenix from the clay attar stills and tanning yards of Kannauj, where ancient ayurvedic principles of balance in all things still reigns supreme. Cuir Curcuma is fine leather cured with lots of earthy golden spice and hot milk, for a result that's unusual enough to be distinctive but delicious enough to be comforting.  Cuir Curcuma cleverly plays on the theme of a traditional Indian drink called Golden Milk, an ayurvedic tonic taken in India to cleanse the bloodstream and balance all doshas. This golden elixir balances the iodic bitterness of turmeric with the sweet creaminess of whole milk, pulverized almonds, sugar, and pistachios. You'll find that the same push-pull between“eat me” and“don't eat me” carried through to the fragrance itself. The crazy-delicious lactones thrown off by the sandalwood create a“steamed milk” effect similar to the one in Santal Basmati, but here it is spicier - woods cooked down with resin until the bottom layer catches and caramelizes. It smells incredibly tasty, but also tasteful, a sprinkle of salty, anisic myrrh stopping the scent from straying too far into gourmandise. Cuir Curcuma is a scent full of drama, its inky medicinal notes making you sit up and take notice. Sweepingly exotic, yet seductively cozy, this is the leather jacket you never thought you could pull off, and now can't live without."," Turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hwyl Eau de Parfum,Aesop," Smoky, woodsy, completely compelling, Hwyl is an explorer's journey into the heart of the eternal forest as only Aesop could present it. Combining gorgeously smooth cedarwood and seductively sexy incense- lovers of CDG Hinoki and Incense Kyoto should clear a spot on the shelf right now- Hwyl adds an intriguing element of depth with an intense base of vetiver that showcases grassy and spicy facets with equal aplomb. It's a fragrance that feels both natural and supernatural, as if one is in tune with the deeper secrets of an ancient wood- and yet, that sense of peace and wisdom coexists perfectly with an undeniable sensuality- this is sexy, smoky incense the likes of which we haven't encountered in a while. Get lost in the forest with Hwyl- you'll be glad you did."," Cypress, frankincense, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30155.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tempo Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," All too often,  patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""It's patchouli, "" the refrain goes,  ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" Tempo,  the wonderful new patchouli scent from Diptyque,  defies such simple-minded rejection- after all,  it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by Tempo's complex,  gorgeous subtlety,  which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet,  delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven,  yet undeniably sophisticated.By building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced,  ethically-harvested varieties of Indonesian patchouli,  Olivier Pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy,  woodsy,  spicy and sweet,  all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. This careful balance is further enhanced with lively,  green violet leaf and nutty,  spicy mate,  which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. Even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans,  give Tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again."," Bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur de Peau Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," As part of Diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, Fleur de Peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. Warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? By wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, Fleur de Peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.The musks at the core of Fleur de Peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. A beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. All together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. It's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for Diptyque's 50th anniversary? Musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived."," Aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lost In Flowers Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," If you've ever tried out a bunch of floral perfumes and said to yourself, nope, just not floral enough, then let us introduce you to Lost in Flowers. Remember the scene from American Beauty when the cheerleader lying in the bath was showered with rose petals? Well, replace the roses with champaca, muguet, and gardenia petals, and that's what wearing Lost in Flowers feels like. Most aptly named, Lost in Flowers is a sublime experience akin to submerging oneself in a warm bath of heady, fragrant, life-giving flowers.   Called joy oil in India, the rare red champaca otto used in Lost in Flowers casts a strange, unearthly glow over the composition. It at first smells innocent, like fruit dipped in cream and wrapped in a clean, juicy shampoo aura. But then it is also smells musky and honeyed, in a way that's more suggestive of intimacy. What dominates, for us, however, is the exquisite gardenia enfleurage, a costly and rare extraction that yields the only true portrait of gardenia that exists in perfumery. Gardenia lovers take note – this is Holy Grail material: creamy, salty, and with a bodacious meatiness that's soulful without ever tripping over into bleu cheese territory. The astringent pop of saffron adds an undertone of leather and iodine, the tagetes a pungent, hay-like facet – colorful touches of Indian attar perfumery in an otherwise tropical picture. Thanks to these spicy, woody touches, and to the salinity of the gardenia, Lost in Flowers never runs sweet or syrupy. It's not even overtly feminine in the traditional sense. In other words, men – knock yourselves out with this one. It's a stunner, no matter which way you slice it."," Indian red champaca oil, lily of the valley, tagetes (marigold), saffron, gardenia enfleurage, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Dead of Night Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," Dead of Night is an oil-based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled from agarwood trees grown on a sustainably-managed 600-acre plantation in Borneo. It's the equivalent of the Slow Food movement, only in oud terms – no chemical inoculation, no rubbery oud aromachemicals, and little interference from humans. This slow way of farming agarwood produces oud oil that is authentically pungent at first, but quickly softens to reveal the supple, tangy aroma of lambskin freshly cured with hay, herbs, and tea. Polished and set in the frame of a fragrance composition like a jewel, a material like this oud shines. Just keep in mind that this is indeed real oud. Those with little to no experience of oud outside of commercial perfumery might be taken aback at how animalistic and raw the note appears at first, but fear not! In time, the fearsome braggadocio of the opening relaxes into a wonderful aroma of soft leather, delicately sour with accents of dried apricots and fermented tea. Violet leaf and bergamot add freshness to the composition, the crushed greenery and citrus notes mimicking the minty sparkle of agarwood grown on the island of Borneo. The florals are subtly placed so as not to distract from the golden, glowing oud, but a glimpse of rose and jasmine emerges in the heart to sweeten its hay-like tone. Subtle brushstrokes of sandalwood and incense help the oud to fade out gently at the end, but, like a theater star, it lingers for hours on stage, in full knowledge that it's what people really came to see."," Bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Silence the Sea Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," Silence the Sea is the true essence of the sea. Forget the horrors of Calone and sweet aquatics – this scent captures all the stony, mineral silence of a deserted beach in winter. Because it is a brand deeply invested in organic, sustainable raw material production, Strangelove NYC was able to source an ethically-harvested (beach cast) piece of ambergris and use it as the star in this composition. And indeed, it is the strange, salty-sweet airiness of ambergris that dominates here. It floats at the center, emanating an aura of fresh marine air, earth, dried newspapers, tobacco, and even the warm funk of a freshly-cleaned horse stable. Ambergris is, in short, the salty, yeasty smell of a child's head after hours of playing on a cold beach. Cleverly, the perfumer has chosen to not overshadow the ambergris but simply flank its already-complex smell with a host of complimentary“flavors”, such as the minty bitterness of angelica, the earthy funk of truffle, and the vegetal, rubbery texture of tuberose. These notes play a valiant second fiddle to the ambergris, emphasizing its flinty, mineral sweetness and extending its unearthly radiance in all directions. Those who love the mysterious, almost indefinable smell of the salt air on a cold beach will adore Silence the Sea."," ambergris, oud, tuber, jasmine, tuberose, angelica",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Melt my Heart Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC," A gourmand lover's dream, but really so much more than just a delicious smell, Melt My Heart is an oil-based fragrance that captures the dizzying sensation of falling in love. And if you imagine that to feel like falling slowly backwards into a featherbed filled with fluffy orris butter and dark chocolate, well, then your vision lines right up with that of Strangelove NYC. Creamy, soft, and utterly addictive, this scent combines the mouthfeel of powdered white chocolate and lipstick with the velvety bitterness of 85% cocoa.   Real orris butter, costlier than most other perfumery materials and described by Chandler Burr as“liquid good taste”, has been used generously here to give the more edible elements spaciousness and lift, like a puff of silvery breath on the cold air. It is the“white” element that contrasts so effectively with the dulcet bitterness of the dark chocolate note. Real oud, ginger, and mandarin are just present enough to draw out various facets of the chocolate and the iris – a spicy, woodsy undertone perhaps - but don't expect too dominant a presence. The sandalwood, in comparison, is a real MVP in this composition, its lush, buttered, coconutty sweetness playing off the dark chocolate and orris to create a delicious Mounds Bar accord that will make you want to nibble your arm. The perfumer, Christophe Laudamiel, says that Melt My Heart is“for falling in love.” Well, we can't imagine anyone smelling this and not being helplessly in its thrall."," ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

But now that it's here, we'll be direct- the hype is real. Crisp, fresh and compelling, made with naturally harvested Australian coastal moss, Pacific Rock Moss is one of the drop-dead sexiest oceanic scents we've ever encountered, a fresh, sea spray scent that speaks of summer days diving into an azure sea.Alongside the vibrantly salty, mineralic coastal moss at the center of Pacific Rock Moss, a bouquet of invigoratingly fresh notes- lemon, sage, and geranium- provide spicy brightness and seductively smooth tonalities.

Be Careful What You Wish For Parfum Extrait,4160 Tuesdays," An oud scent from 4160 Tuesdays? We didn't think it would ever happen, mostly because Sarah herself said it probably wouldn't. After all, with so many companies shoving one oud after another out to market, doing an oud just to do it wouldn't really seem to be on-brand for a perfumer who is forging a wonderful career out of following her own inspirations. But a fateful trip to Dubai left Sarah with some truly exquisite specimens of agarwood extract and, for the first time, she felt the call. So, how to make an oud scent that's also, first and foremost, a 4160 Tuesdays scent? One sniff and the answer is clear. Be Careful What You Wish for is by far the juiciest, fruitiest, most delectably fresh oud we've ever smelled. Energized with tantalizingly tart citrus and shot through with sweet peach, this scent still manages to be as deep, woody and captivating as you could hope for. Five types of real oud will do that, but the balance against the fruit strikes a joyous major chord, while the typical funk of decaying wood is replaced with a grand richness that lasts for untold hours. As tongue-in-cheek as the name may be, if you were wishing for an oud scent that breaks free of convention and exudes real, authentic happiness, 4160 Tuesdays is here to deliver."," Pink grapefruit, juniper berry, peach, white oudh, raspberry, strawberry, gaiac, patchouli, vanilla, plum, dark oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carlisle Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Christened from a majestic 17th-century English steed, Carlisle is a warmly spiced, gourmand-inflected oriental reserved only for the bold. Opening with a colorful burst of juicy, tart green apple spiked with fiery saffron and earthy nutmeg, Carlisle immediately sets itself apart from even Marly's other wondrous gourmands with a grounded, sophisticated earthiness evident from the very first sniff- this is less indulgent dessert pudding and more the aromas of a grand ballroom soiree in full swing, mouthwatering treats mingled with well-groomed aristocracy, elaborate decor and the general spirit of revelry. A richer-yet heart reveals warm, smooth tonka bean and creamy osmanthus- but also gently bitter davana and luscious rose, leading into a true patchouli note that doesn't hold back on the earthiness. However, lovers of Herod and Oajan need not worry, either- alongside that earthy patchouli, a warmly emergent vein of creamy vanilla and sweet opoponax resinoid are every bit as enchantingly seductive as they are in Marly's other masterpieces. As they all reach an enduring harmony in Carlisle's final stages, the glow is enough to make you feel like you, yourself are descended from royalty."," Green apple, saffron, nutmeg, tonka bean, osmanthus, davana, rose, patchouli, vanilla, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Like Phoenician sailors, he pass by untouched coves, pine-covered hills, slopes encased in wild thyme, sage and bay trees, and the rare Gunluk Incense trees, which perfume the air in a breathtaking explosion of colors and essences. This is the smell of Chimaera. A scent of wild and lush nature, both sweet and warm, emphasised by the intense smell of melted caramel that comes from small camps at the foot of the mountain. The fragrance reverberates in the air and is reflected in the blue of the sea, passing by the ruins of the ancient lighthouse at Cape Gelidonya. The tensions and attractions of fire and water have been captured in a perfume extrait made from rare and precious natural raw materials. Naturally beautiful, supernaturally intense, Chimaera is a fragrance you won't soon forget."," Black pepper, lemon, saffron, red earth, white leather, hydrogen, tolu, thyme, bay leaf, iris, pink pepper, carnation, peony, perfect flower, honey, black magnolia, sage, incense, patchouli, cashmere, labdanum, benjamin, caramel, oud, tobacco, copaiba balsam, leather, pine wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Argent Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Compellingly soft, breathtakingly elegant, Patchouli Argent is a patchouli scent that demonstrates the subtlety and versatility of its oft-maligned namesake. By combining the brightness of citrus with lush, smooth florals, gentle incense and a touch of spice, Fragrance du Bois completely re-contextualizes patchouli's natural earthiness in an ethereal mist of romanticism. After the sunshine of a bright, citrussy bergamot opening, a lusciously floral heart of rose and jasmine floats onto center stage, given tantalizing exoticism with a dose of spicy coriander. The patchouli, spliced with soft, asian-inspired incense and gentle musk, wafts in slowly, increasing in intensity with such deliberate patience that there's never an even fleeting moment of harshness- instead, it feels like a guided meditation, a journey to a place both beautifully unknown, yet comfortingly familiar. Whether you're a patchouli lover looking for something unique, or an agnostic yet to discover what patchouli is truly capable of, Patchouli Argent is a unique delight that will linger in your memory."," Bergamot, rose, jasmine, coriander, musk, incense, woody notes, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75721.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Rich with the swooningly ripe, green, creamy aroma of a freshly blended frozen banana drink, enjoyed on a pristine beach next to crystal clear water, this is a tropical gourmand without equal, a stunningly beautiful, gently boozy, delightfully fresh trip to paradise without the airfare or the calories. Picture your toes in the sand, the birds singing in the trees, and the gentle lapping of waves onto the shore.

Bibliotheque Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Rare is the scent that is equally perfect for the home and the body alike, but Byredo's ultra-popular Bibliotheque candle, with its sophisticated blend of fruit, leather and vanilla, has long left its many fans clamoring for a wearable version. We're pleased to say the wait is now over- at least for a limited time. Bibliotheque opens with a mouthwatering burst of peach and plum, juicy and fresh but balanced with a controlled, gently powdery violet heart- rather than candy, it exudes the quiet sweetness of weathered book pages. A smooth, worn leather and crackling patchouli further the scent's evocation of a wood-walled study lined with first editions, a well-loved easy chair, a touch of vanilla conjuring a glass of excellent brandy on the side table. As a candle, it all came together to add evocative elegance to any room, but as an eau de parfum, it's much more versatile than that, the ideal complement to any style from boho chic to gala evening wear. But as a limited edition, we'd advise you to get your bottle as soon as you can, because while intelligence and grace never go out of style, Bibliotheque EDP won't be around forever."," Peach, plum, peony, violet, leather, patchouli, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Impressions de Giverny Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Impressions de Giverny is a scentscape inspired by Monet's famous gardens at Giverny. The artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a living“en plein air” version of his paintings, and so he did. The fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the Giverny garden: first, the famous Japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in Monet's NymphÃ©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. In other words, Impressions de Giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: Japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. The way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. The scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native Japanese fruits and flora. But almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. Threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. There's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. At the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. Finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat – a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. We're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. If you loved Confessions of a Garden Gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling Impressions de Giverny a priority."," Yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Oud - Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," From the Orient, oud conveys mystery and sensuality. From Laos, its land of origin, it draws purity and refinement. This extrait de parfum interpretation is built on a dream of oud””a supremely elegant, precious and rare natural ingredient. It has wrapped itself in a musk and vanilla accord that releases a harmony of spicy rich aromas. An olfactory treasure born of sand, wind and gold. What We Think The extrait version proves that Mr. Kurkdjian knows how to take the wonderful EDP version of the Oud to a deeper, darker and more sensual territory. More intense resins are balanced with the savory saffron note and a feathery-soft vanilla accord that adds to the plushness. Not overly sweet or cloying, Oud Extrait continues to evolove over time with great sillage and longevity.

Parisian Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," What does pure luxury smell like? Of course, that's a question with more than one answer, but now that we've got our hands on Parisian Oud, we'd find it hard to imagine that anything could feel so sumptuous, so lush, so downright sophisticated as this wondrous combination of spice, florals, and a proprietary, organic oud extract so deep and rich that it makes our toes curl.With an opening gambit of cheerful spice provided by pink pepper and cardamom, Parisian Oud develops smartly with a top note of grapefruit, quietly tempered with subtle almond. The body opens into a medley of florals, rose essence, white jasmine, and geranium, before leather and Fragrance du Bois' 100% pure, natural oud builds the scent into a complex, sophisticated symphony. Cistus labdanum and frankincense then add rich, resinous notes to a base that evokes an almost ethereal smokiness, with sandalwood and patchouli easing the ensemble into a soft leather chair of a scent."," Pink pepper, cardamom, grapefruit, almond, rose essence, geranium, white jasmin, pure organic vintage oud, leather, frankincense, moss, labdanum, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75711.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fabulous Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Vulgar, shocking, rude, funny, tongue in cheek....no matter what you think of the name, there's no denying that it's got people talking. But in the kerfuffle over the name, has the fragrance itself been a bit overlooked? We think it might have been. The truth is that Fucking Fabulous is very good. It's an edible but fresh suede scent that borrows a bunch of bitter herbs from old school fougeres, scads of buttery tonka from the gourmand category, and wraps it all up in a musky cashmeran glow. And guess what? Totally works.  Clary sage and lavender top out the scent, their clean, smoky greenness meshing seamlessly with plush orris butter to form a leather note that's both soft and aromatic. Lashings of bittersweet almond and tonka bean beneath give the scent a velvety, almost oily-resinous sweetness, like white chocolate melted down with coffee grounds. The fragrance moves between bitter and sweet, herbal and creamy, powdery and oily over the course of the wear, keeping the journey totally interesting for us. Rumor has it that Tom Ford took one whiff of this creation and exclaimed,“This is fucking fabulous!” We're inclined to agree. Set your feelings aside for the name, take it out for a ride, and you may agree as well."," Lavender, clary sage, bitter almond, tonka bean, orris root, leather, cashmeran, amber, white woods Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Fabulous by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Black Gold Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Bold, fresh, luxurious and sensual, Black Gold is a versatile masculine leather fragrance for today's renaissance man, the rare example of a scent equally comfortable on the beach, at the bar, or in the boardroom. Jump-started with an electric crackle of citrus and spice set against a smooth, compelling lavender, Black Gold soon develops a rich floral heart, kept masculine with the refreshing saltiness of oceanic notes and a perfectly balanced patchouli. And as it dries further, the leather- not too smoky, nor too soft, but with a quiet, confident ruggedness- takes control, lingering for untold hours at just the right volume to carry you from morning to evening, no matter the setting. A signature scent must balance versatility, sophistication, and that so-hard-to-define Wow Factor that can turn heads and make a special someone weak in the knees. After smelling Black Gold, we get the feeling more than a few modern men have just found a signature."," Citrus, oud, lavender, cinnamon, nutmeg, jasmine, violet, rose, sea notes, patchouli, vetiver, woody notes, leather, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
AnOther 13 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," In 2010, Le Labo was commissioned by AnOther Magazine to work on an exclusive scent. This project was born thanks to Sarah Andelman, founder of the world famous Parisian boutique Colette.  Sarah initiated the creative collaboration between Le Labo and Jefferson Hack, editor-in-chief of AnOther Magazine. The result of this collaboration is AnOther 13, a hypnotizing and unique scent. It's composed of ambroxan, a synthetic musk, making AnOther 13 an addictive potion blended with twelve other ingredients such as jasmine, moss and ambrette seeds absolute - which gives it spike and shine. When news broke that Colette would forever close its doors in December 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome AnOther 13 into the permenant Le Labo collection.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Vanille Fatale Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Tom Ford doesn't always do vanilla, but when he does, the results are never anything short of spectacular. Enter Vanille Fatale, a purring, prowling, seductively fanged new vanilla scent whose initial subtleties belie the dangerously glamorous depth within. Opening with a quiet but fiery growl of saffron and coriander, Vanille Fatale's mystery soon deepens as a smoky blend of myrrh and olibanum incense begin to cloud the room, draping themselves around a sweet floral bouquet and an increasingly creamy, sensuously full vanilla. As coffee and roasted barley bring a comforting, yet subtly edgy dose of warm and resinous character, a rich mahogany wood keeps everything in balance, providing enough robust unisex woodsiness to make this scent an easy recommendation for men and women alike. And for those of us who prefer a finely-sharpened blade to blunt force, Vanille Fatale is a sotto voce stunner, ideal for drawing the object of your seduction ever closer without shouting over the room. Think of it as the ultimate secret weapon- and deploy it accordingly."," Saffron, coriander, frangipani, narcissus, coffee absolute, mahogany, roasted barley, vanilla, myrhh, olibanum Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Vanille Fatale by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Tsuki Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Tsuki, meaning“moon”, is a wild green scent that captures the thrilling unfamiliarity of Japanese herbs and aromatics. Imagine crushing the leaves of some strange herb between your fingers in the dark and not knowing what it is, exactly. The minty, rosy sting of geranium is clearly identifiable, but you also smell something like crushed lemon balm and coriander beneath that. The aroma is green, minty, herbaceous, citrusy, and also gin-like thanks to a generous dose of juniper berry. But perhaps the most defining feature here is the fresh, vegetal scent of fennel, which gives the background of the scent a lingering anisic sweetness.  Strangely enough, even if you've never been to Japan or smelled Japanese herbs and aromatics before, there is something that marks this scent out as clearly Japanese, rather than Chinese or Indian - possibly its sense of delicacy and restraint. After a bold start, the scent whittles down into a shadowy trace of powdered ginger and licorice root that, although not loud in volume, remains a gentling presence that calms and focuses the mind throughout the day. With its energizing and uplifting qualities, Tsuki is truly a health tonic in scent form: we can imagine it being doled out in therapeutic doses by doctors to tired, stressed-out patients. Detox from the noise of modern life with this wonderful little elixir."," Geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"Feb. 14, 1912 Eau de Parfum",Rundholz Parfums," Warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, Feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. Opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. A distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. And in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most Rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral. Refined and understated, yet complex and deeply resonant, Feb.14, 1912 is unmistakably a Rundholz creation- and also unlike anything they've offered before."," Orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sasora Parfum,Di Ser," Sasora, like all other fragrances in the Di Ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. Sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the Kodo ceremony, the art of“listening” to Japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. Cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild Hindi oud brought out of the jungles of Assam, in Northern India, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the Arabian Peninsula. The sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. Its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. However, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in Sasora, the perfume.The citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a Zen-like state of bliss. The citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the Himalayas. Both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in Japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a Japanese forest. Considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional Japanese incense sticks. And indeed, Sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from Shoyeido and Baieido – herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. The rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. Real oud oil from noble Assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu – this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office."," Yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kyara Parfum,Di Ser," Japanese treatment of agarwood in perfumery is completely different from that of Middle-Eastern perfumery, so let's take a minute to re-set expectations. Since the 6th century AD, the Japanese have used kyara agarwood in the Kodo ceremony (the way of incense), which is the art of“listening” to scent. Kyara is a very special type of agarwood. It refers to wood from extremely old, wild-grown agarwood trees in mostly Vietnam, now rare to the point of being extinct. The word“kyara” is a description of a scent profile, but also used in grading to mean the highest quality of agarwood. Most authentic kyara pieces were sold to private collectors in Japan, which is how Di Ser came into possession of its own small collection of the precious wood. Kyara is normally heated gently over ash and mica plates as incense; due to its rarity and scarcity, it is never used for distilling oud oil. Until now, that is. In an unprecedented move, Di Ser took the decision to distill oil from its own private collection of kyara. This was an enormously bold and risky undertaking, considering the expense of the raw material, the tiny yield, and the difficulty in extracting oil from such densely-resinated wood. Most oud oil fanatics will never have smelled genuine kyara, either in oil or incense form, so this fragrance, Kyara, is literally the opportunity of a lifetime. The holy grail of oud.  Kyara has a uniquely resinous, green aroma when burned, said to be calming and transporting in equal measure. The opening notes of this 100% natural fragrance are, in fact, pure kyara – verdant, minty, and slightly antiseptic, with the evergreen sting of camphor. Although recognizably oud, the note is as vaporous and clean as early morning mist in a Japanese forest -never dirty or smoky. A massive, gauzy rose note swells up behind the green kyara opening, fleshing out the kyara into a luminous rose-oud concerto against a spicy-woody backdrop that feels like powdered ginger root diffused in sunlight. In keeping with the Japanese classification of oud as rokkoku gomi (meaning ""of six countries"" and the bitter taste from“the five tastes of sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty”), the sweetness and powder is kept in check by the peppery, balsamic-vinegar underbite typical of Vietnamese agarwood. If you've grown weary of oud or simply dislike the more animalic, Arabic treatment of the material, then re-set your nose and give yourself a treat with Kyara, the Japanese silk screen of the oud world. Di Ser's Kyara represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smell authentic kyara agarwood in liquid form – do not cheat yourself of this experience!"," Kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hasunoito Parfum,Di Ser," Hasunoito is based on the lotus flower, the symbol of Di Ser and revered throughout Japan, India, and most Eastern Asian countries for its spiritual significance. The oil of both white and pink lotus is so costly and rare that Di Ser has chosen to focus mostly on the abstract idea of a lotus blossom shooting up through the soil, displaying the duality of strength and softness so characteristic of the flower.  And indeed, the first half of the perfume puts forth a convincing portrait of earth. The specific type of agarwood used here smells like cold, damp clay, with a fuzzy golden haze of something medicinal, like flowers dipped into an antiseptic ointment. Boronia absolute, used only in the most luxurious of all-natural perfumery, lends a fresh, spicy-fruity accent, like purple berries doused in wintergreen and clove. Despite the presence of lotus, rose, ylang, and jasmine, nothing about this perfume reads as floral in tone; rather, it smells like a pleasantly earthy, spicy tea filtered through hospital gauze. Arresting, different, and ultimately kind of addictive, Hasunoito is for people who wish to access higher planes of spirituality without going through the more hackneyed route of incense and flowers."," Agarwood (oud), sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Akanesasu Eau de Parfum,Di Ser," Akane sasu sora,  a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional Japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. It's a phrase imbued with splendor,  suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm,  with awe-inspiring results. To be certain,  a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power,  the same energy,  the same reverence. Luckily,  this eye-openingly bright,  joyous and rich ode to citrus,  jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. As if to mirror the color progression of a sunset,  Akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot,  where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit,  mouthwatering and energizing. A rich,  fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty,  and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth,  leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains,  leaving the sky painted red. A fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation,  Akanesasu is poetry in a bottle."," Orange, Bergamot, Jasmine sambac, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shiragoromo Parfum,Di Ser," Shiragoromo is an amalgamation of two words, shira (meaning white) and goromo (meaning cloth). White is a sacred color in Japan, even appearing as the main color on the Japanese flag, because it stands for purity and childlike innocence. The fragrance itself also smells clean and pure. Predominantly a simple, natural blend of bright yuzu and earthy green woods, Shiragoromo manages to give the feel of a sun-dappled citrus grove that is nonetheless clearly a Japanese citrus grove.  The opening is both sweet and medicinal - oranges and yuzu with the antiseptic bitterness of green aloeswood lurking directly beneath. The purity of the Di Ser approach to perfumery shines through strongly here and great thought has been given to the balance of all five taste elements of Japanese culture: sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty. It takes a long time for the floral elements to break free of the grip of medicinal yuzu and earthy woods, but finally a clean, radiant white jasmine steps out into the clearing. That the flower feels like an extension of the citrus and woods is testament to both the skill of the perfumer and the delicacy of the jasmine oil used here. If you like the idea of white flower petals filtered through damp, earthy green woods and exuberant citrus, then look to Shiragoromo. It's the rare white floral that doesn't actually behave or smell like one; glimpsed at an oblique angle and shaped into something new by the other materials, Shiragoromo feels like a fresh take on a much-traveled theme."," Agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suleyman le Magnifique Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," The longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleyman I presided over the empire's golden age, marked by massive conquest and expansion, cutting edge political and societal reform, and some of the world's greatest artistic and cultural output- to say nothing of his legendary, passionate love for his wife Roxelana, elevated from his harem to be his queen in bold defiance of tradition and convention. This is the man Rasei Fort pays tribute to with Suleyman le Magnifique, a fragrance that celebrates the Sultan's dynamic complexity by blending notes both softly sweet and ferociously animalic. An amalgamation of florals, spice, incense and resin, it's a powerfully irresistible ode to the opulence of an illustrious empire, contrasting bitter-green galbanum against syrupy amber, earthy patchouli with juicy red apple and fiery cinnamon, all against a backdrop of deep, animalic oud. Luxurious, sumptuous and sophisticated, Suleyman le Magnifique is a truly fitting homage to one of history's great figures."," Galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Charlatan Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," From our very first encounter, Fort & Manle has blown us away with their ability to tell wonderfully targeted stories with their scents- tales where the fragrances themselves go far beyond ""matching the mood"" of the copy and become genuine narratives in their own right. Charlatan, a tale of seduction, deception, betrayal, and sin, is by these standards truly a masterwork. Opening with sweetly soft, romantic pear dipped in luscious chocolate, the opening notes evoke a gentle and charming courtship. Even as an element of carnality is introduced via black Perigord truffle, it builds into a passionate symphony of Damascene rose and a lush supporting floral cast, a flirtation exploded into a full-blown romance. Only as a deeply earthy amber and surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter the picture do we see the twist- an element of danger has saturated our storybook, and the elaborate bouquet may contain poison at the center. But then again, some lovers thrive on the edge. Sweet and soft, dark and dangerous, Charlatan is an incredibly creative scent that you'll enjoy experiencing as much as those around you."," Pear, chocolate, perigord truffle, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, vanilla bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Confessions of a Garden Gnome Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," One does not often consider the humble nobility of the garden gnome, and yet his stoicism in the face of the ever-changing seasons is, in its own way, quite beautiful. Confessions of a Garden Gnome pays tribute to this stalwart steward of your backyard, whisking us through a whimsically enchanting year's worth of weather in a single spray, an experience that proves to be as creative and delightful as any we've had in niche fragrance. Confessions opens in springtime, a crisp, green breeze of yuzu-inflected bergamot atop a dewey musk. Summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris. Ultimately, the darkening wood notes lead into winter, while glowing amber suggests the warmth and comfort lurking just out of reach of our heroic gnome, frozen as he is to his territory. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, an ever-evolving fragrant experience that must be worn to be believed. Mister Gnome, we salute you."," Cedar, musk, Sicilian bergamot, coriander, yuzu, pink pepper, lily of the valley, mango, rose, violet leaf, ambergris, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Absolutely Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," Amber fragrances are often associated with warmth, comfort, and beauty- but can an amber be dangerous? In the hands of Rasei Fort- absolutely. Here, the dynamic new nose behind Fort & Manle envisions amber as a trap, a seduction, glowing so brightly that those drawn to its light cannot realize they've become the prey... until it's too late. Don't get us wrong- this is one of the most delicious, warm and downright rapturous ambers we've experienced- rich, resinous labdanum, spiked with benzoin, sweetened with a golden honey and juicy plum. But an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected. Amber lovers, you'll fall head over heels for this rich, creative and ferocious elixir. And those who normally shy away from dessert-sweet amber scents- maybe it's time to try an amber with some fangs."," Musk, amber, benzoin, labdanum, honey, plum, rose, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fatih Sultan Mehmed Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," A tribute to the opulence and glory of the Ottoman Sultanic Empire, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of Mehmed the Conqueror. Crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush Damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. Finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental. Ambergris lovers, we recommend getting your hands on this scent today- put simply, Fatih Sultan Mehmed smells like a million bucks."," Bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Harem Rose Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," A soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? With Harem Rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. Yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the Damascene Rose that Rasei Fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. The result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose. If you love fresher, gentler roses but don't want to smell like a teenager, great news: Harem Rose beckons."," Amber, benzoin, vanilla, rose, cashmere woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maduro Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," In 1961, a Cuban cargo ship, the Reina del Mar, was intercepted by Barbadian pirates on its way to the United States. The ship was scuttled in the ocean and its cargo- tropical fruits and, more importantly, a crate of rare, priceless Cohiba Maduro cigars- sank to the bottom of the ocean. With Maduro, Fort & Manle reimagine the deep, intoxicating aroma of that cargo hold as an explosion of herbaceous spice, fruit, and rich tobacco, a smoky-sweet woody gourmand with unparalleled depth. Clean, vibrant fruit and spice collide with rich, resinous amber, earthy patchouli is smoothed with warm vanilla and woods, and at the center, an intriguingly complex tobacco- dry and spicy one moment, sweet and musty the next. The Reina del Mar may have shipwrecked, but Maduro, the fragrance it inspired, is a magnificent vessel indeed."," Basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, atlas cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bojnokopff Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle," An extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution Russia's master illusionists, Bojnokopff (formerly titled Mr. Bojnokopff's Purple Hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. Our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean French lavender. As the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of Belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. As the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. Who is the mysterious Mr. Bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? Would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?"," Oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Slowdive Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," Is the name of Hiram Green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to Slowdive, the seminal UK shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? The perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the Indian summer air is almost palpable."" But it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling Green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. This is the feeling of Slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. The result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of Hiram Green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. While the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve."," Neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baque Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse," We'd heard talk of Baque, a long-discontinued Slumberhouse original that pre-dated our relationship with Josh Lobb's tantalizing creations, but truth be told, we weren't too worried about it. How could a different Slumberhouse tobacco scent steal our hearts away from the mouthwatering fruit-laced smoking pipe of Kiste, or the smoky-sweet darkness of (dearly departed) Jeke? But now, Baque is, well, back, and we're delighted to discover that it's a dynamic, vividly-painted tobacco scent that lands squarely in the middle of our two previous favorites. Combining syrupy, fruity apricot with sweet, spicy tobacco and a deep strain of boozy richness, Baque hypnotizes and delights, seduces and compels, and most importantly, draws us deep within an vivid, gorgeous imaginary landscape as only Slumberhouse can."," Apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Camel Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Camel is a series of elegant contradictions. Technically, it's an oriental, but in sidestepping all of the clichÃ©s of the genre, it retains a surprisingly brisk, fat-free mien. It features a plethora of rich, sticky notes like dates and dried fruit, but is as dry as a glass of champagne. Frankincense, musk, and oud lend a sinuous exoticism that speaks to the East; yet Camel has a distinctly retro flourish that places it firmly among the flanks of classic French perfumes such as My Sin and Arpege. We sense several shifting layers of scent in Camel, all of them fascinating. First, a topnote of dried fruit dipped in green frankincense sets the pace: resinous, rich, but also dry, tart almost. Imagine the steamy sweetness of dried apricots and plums laid out in a souk, pricked by the waxy sourness of preserved lemons and pickled mangoes just beneath. The mouthwatering notes of the opening give way to an animalic floral heart – a none-too-clean jasmine and orange blossom whipped into a soapy, leathery froth by civet and musk. All this is spread over a gritty amber drydown that manages to smell like the friction between hot sand, cold soap, and silk sheets. Although Camel strikes us as more Madame Bovary than Scheherazade, it nonetheless manages to capture the contradictory nature of the camel, itself permanently poised between froideur and rage."," Dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Day Dreams Eau de Parfum,Montale," Like the warm summer nights in Greece, where the daylight is endless and the air is ripe with flowers. Montale's whisper-soft Day Dreams is about what is left when all cares melt away. A juicy burst of mandarin opens up a romantic whirlwind of white flowers - neroli, jasmine, orange blossom - and a tropical hit of tiare. As it all floats along a fluffy cloud of vanilla and coconut, the sensual, musky fragrance proves its worth as truly a dream come true."," Orange blossom, jasmine, mandarin, neroli, tiare, sandalwood, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35483.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intense Black Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Montale," Imagine the elegance of Black Aoud, with its perfect pairing of pert roses and mellow, woodsy oud and sandalwood base. Now take it up a notch in presence, sillage, and projection with Intense Black Aoud. It's like adding a harmonized chorus for a song - the precious Cambodian oud is magnified with rich, earthy Indonesian patchouli leaves and a hint of tart mandarine. The proud rose glides along the powerful musky woods for a warm, robust new take on the original masterpiece."," Rose petals, mandarine, aoud, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35481.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arabians,Montale," Arabians is about capturing that feeling of royal adventure, with wind in your hair and a lover by your side. Inspired by the King of the Desert, the Arabian Horse, this regal fragrance takes the classic fougÃ¨re and takes it for a musky, sensually spiced spin. Sweet clean lavender heads the way, accompanied by a sexy blend of cardamom, rose, warm patchouli, and the most subtle use of oud by Montale we've seen yet. The result is stunningly seductive - an elegant leathery fougÃ¨re that dares you to lean in and come along for a mysterious ride."," Lavender, leather, red thyme, cardamom, patchouli, Malaysian aoud, vetiver, rose, amber, animal musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35482.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ummagumma Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," As a multi-sensory artist, Bruno Fazzolari's creations pulse with the energy of magical realms, from the blazing glow of Feu Secret to the crackling fluorescents of Room 237. But with Ummagumma, Fazzolari ushers us into his darkest, sultriest locale yet- a languorous world of rich gourmand notes that flow with indulgently deliberate sweetness- aromatic, smooth tobacco, resinous labdanum, creamy vanilla and sandalwood- and foremost of all, a mouthwateringly warm, rich chocolate note, sweet and robust without a drop of fake sugar. This is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old. Perhaps it's not right to call it a gourmand at all- it's a portal to yet another world that defies too-simple categorization while at the same time feeling immeasurably appropriate for the one category it firmly falls into- that of an original Bruno Fazzolari creation. Chocolate lovers, winter adventurers, and all who appreciate original art- don't miss Ummagumma."," Saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Vanilla Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Black Vanilla by Mancera is a milky floral vanilla that soothes rather than challenges, which is exactly what we all need every now and then. Soft hints of blackcurrants, coconut, and peach cast a gauzy veil of fruit over the vanilla accord, itself sheer and barely sweet, like coconut milk put through a milk frother. The juicy berries and peach lend a discreetly flirtatious vibe, but in general, the lack of syrupy sweetness marks this out as a refined, grown-up vanilla scent.  In time, a powdery rose emerges from the peachy, berried vanilla froth, creamy puffs of jasmine petals and candied violet trailing soon after. The florals, diffused in an enormous cloud of soapy white musk, feel more like a swirl of expensive cosmetic powder than freshly-cut flowers, giving the scent a distinctly clean, feminine vibe. In terms of sillage and longevity, Black Vanilla lasts the day, but is soft rather than loud. Despite the name, therefore, Black Vanilla is truly a perfect fragrance for days when you need your scent to stay low-key but still smell amazing. Gently feminine, its cluster of powdery flowers, musk, and lightly frothed vanilla-coconut milk feels more like a perfect veil of milky, floral lotion rather than a full-on perfume."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Tobacco Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Red Tobacco by Mancera is an incredibly potent, sexy tobacco fragrance with enough spice to turn the heat up on a cold winter's night. The opening is deceptively sharp and fresh, a one-two punch of leathery saffron and crisp apple, bathed in a haze of that smoky, medicinal Mancera oud. This phase smells like oud chips fermenting in a vat of honey – medicinal, slightly pungent, and deliciously sweet-n-sour. But it's not long before the scent shakes off any semblance of freshness and melts into a thick, juicy amber that smells like a river of molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco, dried plums, and fruitcake. Red Tobacco is so confidently spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon, it practically sizzles. With time, the sweet, rich pipe tobacco emerges from its bed of amber and spice to reveal itself as the true star. The bombastic sweetness of the scent is toned down a little by the slightly dirty, smoky oud note and a patchouli note that smells like damp dark chocolate. A naughty little cousin to Montale's Honey Aoud, Red Tobacco will warm your bones in winter and the blood of anyone who picks up your scent."," Saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, Haitian vetiver, Madagascar vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
California Snow Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," California Snow crackles with the electricity of a soirÃ©e high in the Hollywood Hills. White-blonde starlets loll on the lawn, rolling joints and listening to the sound of the coyotes. Studio execs, excited by the snowy mounds of illicit substances on every surface, long to engage. But the scent of the hot night air – earth, sage, cannabis – is too bewitching to focus on anything else. California Snow's glossy, filmed-in-HD surface belies a certain“earth mother” wildness. A rose so bright and crisp it smells more like an apple is the first surprise; the damp earthiness of the soil tincture the second. The combination of the crystalline with the muddy is utterly charming, like a glammed-up cool kid suddenly locating their hippy side, and kicking off their Jimmy Choos to roll around in the dirt. A witchy sage works with aromatic hay, chamomile, and wild mountain tea to dry out the scent, turning it from earthy and wet into something you might crumble up and smoke. It finishes as a gust of warm, grassy desert air off the scrublands high up in the Hollywood Hills. With its clever contrasting of crisp, clean notes with grungy, earthy ones, California Snow is provocative in a good-humored way, like a star who chooses to pair a pristine white tuxedo with beaten-up plimsolls for a red carpet event."," Sage, tea, chamomile, coumarin, narcissus, rose, hay, cannabis, musk, soil tincture, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Warszawa Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," Warsaw- one of Europe's largest, most historic, greatest capitals, teeming with culture, tradition, beauty and life. And through that hum of history, the women of Poland- beautiful, sophisticated, brilliant, resilient- have led the way. They are Puredistance and Antoine Lie's inspiration for Warszawa, a classically-styled knockout of a feminine scent, overflowing with floral warmth, vintage beauty and unparalleled depth. Warszawa opens with the all the dazzling radiance of a noblewoman making her grand entrance, resplendent in sparkling, juicy grapefruit and bright green galbanum. As she sweeps into the room, a smile and a witticism for each honored guest, she trails a lush and exquisite floral sillage, swooningly romantic jasmine with the earthy-buttery depth of pure orris lending sensuous form. And long after she's departed, her impression is felt with a soft but lingering base of gently rich patchouli and lightly spicy vetiver. A jewel of a fragrance named for a jewel of a city, Warszawa is the best of European elegance and Polish beauty in one unforgettable scent."," Galbanum, grapefruit, violet leaf, jasmin absolute, broom, orris butter, patchouli, vetiver, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Not a Perfume Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"“If my different creations had one thing in common, it would be the presence of an ingredient I am particularly fond of. Overdosed in Lady V and Calamity J, more discrete in Miss Charming and Citizen Queen, I use it regularly to bring elegance to my creations because of its unique and inimitable woody, musky finesse. So, this time I have created a perfume out of this one ingredient - a perfume that wouldn't be in the conventional sense of the term.  I will leave you to discover it on your skin because it is only through contact that its secrets will be unveiled."" ””Romano Ricci, FounderAlong with today's minimalist trend, Not a Perfume follows suit and adds extremity, irreverence and conceptual characteristics to deliver a true art form. You have now stepped into a new and elegant form of perfumery. With Not a Perfume you get exactly what you want from the scent: it does not evolve; it is not a composition, but rather a particular fragrance that is very strong & lasting on skin. Just like the white packaging it's housed in, its makeup is fresh, clean, and clinical. This brand new concept from Romano Ricci is a modern day fragrance that is 100% synthetic and created without allergens. Not a Perfume is made of 1 single synthetic ingredient Cetalox. Cetalox is a molecular creation that comes from the organic research. Developed by Firmenich in the 1950's to replace Ambergris, a very rare natural secretion of whales, Ambroxan comes in the form of white crystals. It is usually used as a back note in perfume composition, even if its smell is curiously quite far from its original inspiration.", Cetalox,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mx. Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," Pronounced“Mix”, Mx. is named after the gender neutral title replacing Mr., Mrs. and Ms., announces a new gender fluid era where perfumes are not rigidly gendered. ""X"" marks the spot of freedom.True to form, Mx. doesn't abstain from taking a position on gender ”” it leaves all options open. Mx. dances between sweet creaminess and brusque, aromatic woods, playing both sides of the fence with perfect poise and balance. Its mouthwatering, almost gourmand opening salvo of peppery saffron fits neatly over a heart of rugged Australian sandalwood and cedar spiked with black pepper, ginger, cacao and frankincense.Dabs of castoreum and birch tar in the base draw all the other notes together in a sensual embrace, sending a haze of smoke and leather up through the nutty, earthy sandalwood. A crÃ¨me brulÃ©e of whipped woods, saffron, incense, and smoke, Mx. is the fragrance equivalent of a soft feminine face being kissed all over by a masculine, stubbled one. We defy you to put it on and not shiver with pleasure."," Indian ginger, Madagascar black pepper, saffron, Ethiopian olibanum, Australian sandalwood, Virginian cedarwood, Haitian vetiver, Indonesian patchouli, Laotian benzoin, Russian birch tar, Venezuelan cacao, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monstera Eau de Parfum,Xinu," Monstera pays tribute to the scent of Monstera Deliciosa (”œDelicious Monster”), a lush plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southern Mexico. Although Monstera produces fruit, the focus here is on the green, aromatic scent of the leaves, stem, and plant itself.When talking about green scents, it's important to define the type of greenness – green perfumes can smell vegetal, herbaceous, bitter, dewy, bitter, or waxy depending on the notes used. What's astonishing about Monstera is just how juicy and lush the greenery smells here, like a leaf that's been snapped open, allowing great big droplets of plant juice and sap to seep out. The scent supports the crunchy greenery with an accord that smells like damp earth, bitter moss, and the sharpness of a pineapple-like note from the Monstera fruit. In its final movement, orchid and datura lend a subtly creamy white floral tone, the orchid in particular giving the scent a hint of bitter cocoa and vanilla. But in general, the aromatic greenery of a Mexican jungle is what lingers here, both in the mind and on the skin. Monstera is a leafy green scent that never once loses its focus, for a result that's both beautiful and technically impressive."," Leaves and fruit of Monstera, sacred ear flowers, white datura, bullhorn orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
OroNardo Eau de Parfum,Xinu," OroNardo is a word that combines two Spanish words: nardo, which means tuberose, the famously fleshy white flower that's native to Mexico, and oro, meaning gold, hence OroNardo (”œGolden Tuberose”).Being both Mexican and famous for his lyrical treatment of white florals, it is no surprise that Rodrigo Flores-Roux is able to pay proper tribute to the gorgeous Mexican tuberose. First, he flanks the tuberose with a very indolic mock orange - a sweet-smelling white flower that smells like jasmine petals dipped in honey – to accentuate its naturally fleshy sexiness. Then he draws out its green, camphoraceous freshness through judicious use of marigold, a spicy, herbaceous flower with a twinge of vegetal bitterness. The result captures the totality of the freshly-plucked flower – tuber, stems, petals, leaves and all. The texture of OroNardo is also a delight, transitioning gracefully from whipped cream to a breeze of golden, pollinated powder. Delicate and green rather than heavy, OroNardo shows that, in the right hands, tuberose doesn't have to be the show-stopping monster it's often reputed to be."," Mock orange, floral notes, marigold, tuberose, white nerium oleander",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fumabat Eau de Parfum,Couteau de Poche," Fumabat: an unusual name for unusual perfume. Parid Cefa takes familiar materials – pine, carnation, frankincense, patchouli – and rearranges them in a novel way that that you don't smell what you're expecting to smell. Expectations are upended. For example, despite the presence of mint, green tea, and galbanum in the topnotes, Fumabat is neither green nor particularly fresh.Instead, it's a tarry spice oriental with a big old school drydown of oakmoss, patchouli, and soapy leather. Surprised that fragrances with such throwback appeal are being produced in small artist's ateliers in Brooklyn? Yeah, so are we. In a good way. For all its retro style, Fumabat feels exciting and new. We are taken on a dizzyingly ride from spicy carnation, oakmoss, and galbanum, which appear to reference classic perfumery, to exotic, smoky frankincense, which brings us straight to the sultan's harem, and even detouring briefly to a grungy, 1970's style patch. Somehow, Fumabat manages to pull everything together brilliantly, as if perfumery had always been missing a vital piece of the puzzle – Arabian Nights meets Burt Reynolds – and this brand stepped in to provide it."," Green tea, galbanum, mint absolute, Bulgarian black pine, carnation, Somalian frankincense, vetiver root, leather, oakmoss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aguamadera Eau de Parfum,Xinu," Aguamadera is an amalgamation of two words in Spanish: agua for water, and madera for wood, thus Aguamadera meaning“waterwood”. This name makes sense when you consider that this is a scent based on the scent of agave, a tough succulent native to Mexico whose hard, spiky leaves give us both agave syrup and mezcal. The mezcal theme is fully explored in Aguamadera, with a lime note up top that's so tart it almost draws saliva from the mouth. There's a hit of salt with an outdoorsy freshness that recalls a gust of sea air. All this might be written off as just another riff on a summer freshie were it not for the incredible woody notes that form the ballast of the scent –  guaiac wood gives the scent the smokey agave spirit of mezcal, and cedarwood a nuance of sweat-lodge coziness that lends enormous charm and warmth. The woods are more creamy than dry or radiant, which works exceptionally well against the spikier salt and citrus notes. If you're in the market for a tangy, citrusy fragrance with a natural, non-abrasive woody drydown that goes on forever, then Aguamadera should be on your radar."," Agave, lime, guaiac wood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Copala Eau de Parfum,Xinu," Copala focuses on copal resin, used as incense by the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America since the time of the Mayan civilization. Black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. Here, it is the good-natured sweetness of Mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. The faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. Smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry Mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. Instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. What's most impressive about Copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the XinÃº rendition is positively monastic."," Pink pepper, copal, mesquite, Mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Attar AT Perfume oil,Tauer Perfumes," ""I was invited for tea in the Saudi desert one fine evening, sitting together with perfume lovers and friends. We discussed the world of oudh and attar. We talked and smelled and watched the sun hiding behind the dunes. I will never forget.Coming home, I just had to continue working on an attar: dark, arabic, rough, strong– but not loud. I wanted an attar beyond the ordinary. I wanted the Tauer Attar to come with an element of modesty. One drop on each arm is enough to go with you through the day with the scent staying close to the skin."" –Andy TauerPlease note: Due to the small size of the bottle, samples will unfortunately not be available. The Attar is a new product that is unique in the Tauer collection. 5ml pure perfume oil, without any alcohol or other fillers added."," Animalic leather, birchtar, Java vetiver, dark dry woods, sandalwood, hints of Jasmine, cistus, and castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31465.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
French Affair Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," French Affair pays tribute to the fiercely elegant chypres of Paris in the 1970's – earthy, mossy affairs worn by the free-thinkers of the world who strolled through the Left Bank like they owned it. And they did. Women in Le Smoking tuxedos unbuttoned to the navel, men in full-on Oscar Wilde mode: nonconformists who smelled of Gauloises smoke, crushed velvet, and Aramis 900. But French Affair is no nu-chypre pretender. It is authentically, damply, unmistakably oakmoss-y, with that familiar inky feel that gives chypres their backbone. A rich wave of Indonesian patchouli - earthy and camphoraceous - jumps out at you from the topnotes, riding hand in hand with the moss to create an accord of coppery, freshly-turned soil. The lychee note smells more like overripe plum, momentarily sweetening the earthier notes. Violet leaf streaks across the loamy gloom, as surprising as a camera flash. But the dark, musty earth notes are what prevail – a bolt of black velvet unfolded after many years in storage. Eventually, this accord reveals a spiced, plummy rose and a pungent cedary drydown that is both aromatic and slightly sweaty. French Affair stands shoulder to shoulder with the great patchouli chypres of the 1970's, Aramis 900, Aromatics Elixir, and Givenchy Gentleman. Close your eyes and breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke floating through velvet collars soaked in patchouli. Dark, moody, and viciously sexy, French Affair is indeed a very French Affair."," bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, Atlas cedar, angelica, pepper, Indonesian patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Note de Yuzu Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," In Japan, when the yuzu citrus ripens in winter, traditional baths are taken with the whole yuzu fruits floating in the water, imparting their delightful scent and invigorating the senses. Note de Yuzu, Heeley's collaboration with the Tokyo-Parisian fashion house and music label Maison KitsunÃ© takes the yuzu bath as the perfect point of departure to encapsulate British, French, and Japanese influences into a sparkling, soothing, sensual fragrance.  Note de Yuzu opens as exuberantly as a bottle of champagne, the celebratory pop filling the air with effervescent droplets. The energy and zest of Japanese yuzu are drenched in hydration with tart lemon and fruity mandarine. As the immediate fruity freshness softens, the gentle marine notes unfold like saltwater on skin, reminiscent of Heeley's iconic Sel Marin, but with a clean, sensual white musk base. Note de Yuzu is a charming tonic for the senses, imparting that cool-kid vibe of relaxed chic done right."," Yuzu, lemon, mandarine, sea salt, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dolce Amalfi Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," If the most breathtaking locales in the world are a combination of sheer beauty, but also of contrast and drama, then the Amalfi Coast's reputation is richly deserved. Colorfully elaborate structures are peppered throughout volcanic crags and wildflower-lined cliffs carry winding roads that overlook narrow beaches astride azure-blue Mediterranean water, where luxury super-yachts dock next to simple sailboats. It's enough to make the world's greatest writers stand in abject silence and simply appreciate how beautiful a place can be. This stunning tableau is what Casamorati set out to capture in Dolce Amalfi, a delightfully brisk, sweetly fruity, warmly balsamic new scent available for the first time outside of Xerjoff's luxury boutique in Dubai. From the first sniff, we can see why they wanted to keep it all to themselves. Juicy apple is made all the more redolent with a sophisticated spice blend, while smoothly seductive incense is warmed in the sun via a rich collection of balsamic notes and vanilla. All together, it's a cheery, fruity, sunny, yet grown-up dose of smooth relaxation, as any good testament to Amalfi should be. Take a trip to the most beautiful place on the planet, no matter where you are, with a single spritz of Dolce Amalfi."," Apple, saffron, quince, cardamom, clove, incense, tolu, vanilla, tonka, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Stars - Malesia Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Malesia: a biogeographical region stretching from Southern Thailand to the islands of the South Pacific, home to some of the world's most mysterious locales and exotic flora and fauna. Within its borders lie adventure, romance, riches... and danger. This is the olfactory landscape Xerjoff has set out to map, and the results are a scent that washes over us in waves of richly balsamic, fiercely animalic, and soothingly smooth floral luxury. Malesia is stunningly rich right from the opening, with the exquisite oud blend seeping even into the luscious lily of the valley top note. Complex gurjum balsam tempered with amyris-strengthened sweet amber flows through the heart, while the oud only increases in strength as the warm, musky vanilla of the base uncurls with languid confidence. When all is balanced, a glow settles atop the skin that lingers for hours and hours. Comforting and challenging in equal measure, Malesia is a deeply sensual memento from the adventure of a lifetime."," Lily of the valley, gurjum balsam, amyris, amber, oud, vanilla, tonka bean, tolu, labdanum, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51146.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Stars - Ceylon Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," While tea scents are often thought of as delicate and ethereal, there's no reason why that must be so- tea, after all, is a dynamic substance, equally capable of powerful richness and deeply spiced aromas. While soft tea scents are undeniably beautiful, why stop there? This is the beauty of Ceylon, a scent that dares to surround exquisite black tea from Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) with decadently luxurious oriental and gourmand notes, producing a sumptuous tea scent unlike any other.Ceylon opens with a sweetly honeyed drop of bergamot, which quickly smooths the way for the tea at the center of the show- jet-black, richly toasted, and the perfect compliment to a sensually smooth blend of Malaysian oud and Indian sandalwood. As a mouthwatering vanilla and powdery amber emerge, the notes blend with astonishing balance, leaving the tea as the unifying note between sweet, creamy, powdered, woodsy and balsamic elements. As complex as it sounds, it wears like a dream. Discover the sultrier side of tea- as only Xerjoff could produce."," Honey, bergamot, jasmine, black tea, oud, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cruz Del Sur I Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Inspired by the mystery and majesty of the untouched tribes of the South American jungle, Xerjoff's Cruz Del Sur series radiates with compellingly fresh energy and the thrill of exploration. For the first entry in the duo, we find ourselves in the canopy of the rainforest, the air rich with the smell of ripening fruit, wild, spicy vegetation, and the rum from our expedition packs. The raw power of the animals that rule this domain is expressed through powerful doses of leather and castoreum, while the untold riches of the lost city we search for comes through in a deep base of labdanum, myrrh and amber. We may be lost- or we may be closer to finding ourselves than ever before. Wild and refined, exotic and comforting, Cruz Del Sur I is a treasure unto itself."," Rum, bergamot, grapefruit, cedar, cinnamon, dried fruits, cumin, labdanum, myrrh, castoreum, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51143.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

For the second of the duo, our journey takes us to the center of a flourishing mango grove, where the very air seems overflowing with mouthwatering tropical juiciness. Humming undercurrents of vibrantly green florals energize and excite, while rich, earthy vetiver and robust cedar remind us that the oldest and most powerful living things on the earth are the very trees that surround us. Our expedition has yet to locate the endless stores of gold we were promised, but we've already found indescribable wealth in the heart of the jungle. Lovers of deep, rich, juicy fruit scents, rejoice- Cruz Del Sur II is a sumptuous delight."," Mango, pineapple, apple blossom, floral bouquet, green leaves, vetiver, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51144.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Stars - Alexandria II Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Alexandria- the thousand-year capital, among the very greatest and most enduring cities in history, and a shining center of history, culture and wealth. Now, Xerjoff endeavors to rebuild Alexandria to the height of its Hellenistic glory, gifting us a fragrance that overflows with rich fruits, spiced woods, and sumptuous florals that sing with the stunning accomplishments of this jewel of the ancient world. Alexandria II opens with a mouthwatering note of apple, decadently juicy, sprinkled with precious cinnamon and contrasted with sophisticated lavender. A heart of luscious Bulgarian rose cries out with passion, smoothed by lily of the valley, whose poisonous nature belies a hint of danger- after all, how often through history did Alexandria come under deadly siege? So, too, does the extravagantly rich base juxtapose the comforting and the dangerous, as smooth, ambered vanilla meets a virile blend of matured ouds from Laos and Thailand. Robust, complex and positively enchanting, Alexandria II is a striking evocation of one of humanity's greatest achievements."," Apple, cinnamon, rosewood, lavender, cedar, lily of the valley, rose, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51145.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Birch Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," To work on Birch, Andrea Maack relocated to her family cabin hidden away in the Icelandic highlands. Her childhood summers were spent in this wooden cabin, surrounded by the scent of birch trees. An atmospheric fragrance above all, Birch transports the wearer to the solace of the Arctic tundra, a million miles away. An airy bergamot creates a cool breeze with lightly spicy ginger and pink pepper, sensually drifting along. The character of the scent lies in the meeting of dark guaiacwood and cypriol, however, that capture the arctic woodland, with rising columns of bonfire smoke. Birch is gorgeously evocative, alternating between the fresh cold air and smoky, earthy woods. It's one of those scents that you wear for yourself, to breathe in deep and enter another world."," Bergamot, pink pepper, ginger, guaiac wood, cypriol, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52811.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beach Hut Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," When is a beach scent more than just a beach scent? When it's part of Amouage's stunningly inventive suite of new releases. Beach Hut Man, the newest from the Midnight Flower collection, is no mere salty aquatic- instead, as told by Creative Director Christopher Chong, it's ""the story of an iridescent aromatic idyll that unfolds in the fragrant wild garden of a beach hut."" What does that mean in plain language? It means that Beach Hut Man is equal parts oceanic and intensely green, for an utterly unique and exciting new masculine that invigorates and relaxes in equal measure.With a bracing opening of mouthwatering mint, smooth orange blossom and bitter galbanum, Beach Hut explodes with complexity from the very first spritz. Salty, spicy vetiver evokes the ocean and the garden in equal measure, while wild green moss and ivy and earthy patchouli add to the naturalistic, yet relaxed, vibe. As it dries, a rich and masculine base of dry woods lingers for hours. Born in an oceanside paradise but sophisticated and sexy enough for a palace, Beach Hut Man is a creative and compelling new masculine that we think is destined end up alongside Amouage's very best."," Mint, orange blossom, galbanum, vetiver, moss, ivy, patchouli, myrrh, dry woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41888.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bruma Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Bruma means“solstice” in Latin, which brings to mind something one might wear to a pagan ritual or to howl at the moon. But the word ”˜Bruma' is also close to the French word brume for mist, and we think that this word fits the scent better. It begins with a gentle misting of iris, violets, and peony, all swirled together into a creamy, fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum, part lipstick. A rooty iris stands at the center, quietly gathering itself up into a soft leather, aided by black pepper, which accentuates the naturally rubbery facets of peony. Thanks to a touch of lavender and galbanum, the suede or leather accord grows ashier, greener, and drier, the ghost of Tuscan Leather flickering at the edges. It is only after a while that one begins to notice the delicious creaminess of the base coming forward: damp jasmine petals pressed into spicy, milky tonka bean and the saltwater taffy of labdanum. All the while, Bruma retains a delightfully gauzy texture, which makes it an easy wear, even in hot weather. The lingering impression is of a fruity violet suede accord over dry ash, resin, and finally, the nutty, baked hay smell of tonka and vetiver. It is not the striding Valkyrie implied by the name; but for days when you want to smell just plain amazing rather than fierce, Bruma is the perfect choice."," black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55965.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
II (Deux) Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," II, or Deux (French for two), is all about new beginnings: the second act, rebirth, regeneration. Essentially, Deux is an aromatic scent filled to brimming with the piercingly green smell of regrowth – fig saplings, plants, and young conifers pushing their way up through layers of humus and pine needles to meet the sun. With lots of aromatic juniper and bitter orange, it is brisk and unsentimental, an impression confirmed by its salty, woody musk in the drydown. Like all the perfumes in the Cire Trudon range, it is perfectly unisex. Although not listed, we smell a lot of kitchen garden notes in here too, particularly the resinous snap of tomato leaf, mint, basil, and the milky juice of fresh fig leaf. The vibrant, stemmy smell of crushed leaves is intoxicating, bringing back memories of small, childish hands stained green with plant juice. This is a scent that crawls with life. Wearing it, you can almost sitting in a forest clearing, face turned to the sun, surrounded by the fertile smell of tender green shoots and leaves pushing up to the surface, like a fast motion sequence on a nature documentary. Deux is the perfect fragrance with which to welcome in the rites of spring and drive away the cold stoniness of winter. Bristling with verdant energy, think of Deux as a shot of antioxidant-rich green juice to stimulate the blood and re-start the engine."," green leaves, orange bigarade, pine, pepper, juniper, cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55966.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mortel Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Mortel proves there's a reason why incense has been burned in churches for thousands of years: it just smells darned good. Yes, incense is used to purify the air and to rid places of worship of bad spirits. But the truth of the matter is that the scent of frankincense, labdanum, myrrh, and benzoin is almost universally pleasing. The question then becomes how to build an incense fragrance in a way that it stands out from countless others in the genre. Some use room-filling synthetics to lift the resins, some are dense and airless, and some are airy, bright – almost soapy. Mortel is a bone-dry, monastic take on the theme, differing from other entries in the field by being both wearable (in a casual, everyday sense) and supremely natural in feel. It skips entirely the lime-peel brightness of the topnotes of frankincense, plunging instead directly towards a heart of dark, waxy, smoked-out resin, with a vein of sizzling black pepper. The structure stacks churchy resins around a core of extremely dry labdanum, which here completely lacks the friendlier caramelic tones of its usual presentation. Myrrh, licorice-like and earthy, is particularly prominent, its dark oiliness underlined by a generous helping of nutmeg, pimento, and pepper. The toasty tones of Virginia cedar form a bridge between the dusty cistus in the heart to the powdery benzoin in the far dry-down. But, although Mortel is undeniably dry and austere, its dryness is organic, like the natural dustiness of soot or charcoal. Calming and meditative, it is an incense that will elevate the spirit without grinding the wearer down. Believe us, that's a hard balance to strike, and in our opinion, Mortel nails it."," Black pepper, pimento, nutmeg, frankincense, Virginia cedar, cistus, myrrh and benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55967.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Olim Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Olim, Latin for ”˜once', is supposed to evoke the excess and vanity of the French court under King Louis. And indeed, this is one pompadour of a fragrance, full of glittering powder, resin, golden bergamot, exotic spice, and intimate musks. Breathing this in, one might imagine the powdered wigs and sugary petit fours of Marie Antoinette, as well as the aromatic lavender waters splashed on by courtiers after their evening toilette. It is glittering, bold, and full-figured – an oriental with its corset stays loosened.We begin at the afternoon tea table of the young Queen and her adoring coquettes. A golden bergamot is doused heavily in powdered sugar, turning it from tart to fizzy and sweet: a lemon sherbet in fragrance form. Aromatic herbs in the heart sparkle – dewy lavender and anise, turning the air violet as the gentlemen drench their wigs and clothes to freshen them. But there is something sensual and skin-like underneath the bright elements, a combination of creamy musk, clove, and patchouli giving the lavender and bergamot a naughty Jicky edge. The deliberate clashing of citrus and cream, aromatics and resin, well – that's the classic recipe for when you want to do an oriental right. And Olim gets it right. If you love the warm sexiness of big-boned orientals such as Shalimar, Musc Ravageur, and Opus 1144, then Olim ought to give you a thrill."," bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55968.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Revolution Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon," Inspired by the chaos in the streets of Paris during the French Revolution, Revolution is a fragrance full of the smells of danger – the peppery smoke of gunpowder mingling with raging fire, leather riding boots, and spilled musket oil. Such accords have the potential to come off as harsh or extreme, but in the experienced hands of British perfumer Lyn Harris, they convey the excitement of battle with a buttery smoothness that makes the scent a breeze to wear. So we have rugged, ashy leather and the sooty smoke from burned-out houses, but with a creamy elemi underpinning that immediately softens the punch. Cade oil muscles its way past the buttery leather, filling the nostrils with its intensely green-black, smoky smell. Adding to the powerful impression of chaos created by the opening, a peppery papyrus combines with dusty cedar to create a searing flash of gunpowder from a newly-spent musket. Together, these notes conjure up the image of a young soldier, taking temporary shelter in a burned-out house on the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, the searing smell of soot, ash, singed leather boots, and gunpowder softened by the creamy smell of ancient cedar bookcases, sheaves of paper, and the whiff of incense from a nearby church. And it's this juxtaposition between burned and creamy elements that gives the scent its power to soothe and excite at the same time.  Revolution is the smell of the vestiges of civilization meeting the approaching fires of the crusaders."," elemi, angelica, cedar, papyrus, patchouli, cade, incense, cistus, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55969.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Satin Mood Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Of the many fragrances to attempt to reinterpret oud for the western palette, very few have been as much a runaway success as Francis Kurkdjians Oud Satin Mood, a gorgeously textured, impossibly smooth tapestry of delicate spice, elegant florals, and mouthwatering vanilla layered with an exquisite specimen of pure Laotian oud. Now, for the first time ever, this sumptuous delight is available in a sinfully concentrated extrait de parfum, where the rose (now a decadent combination of Turkish and Bulgarian roses) is lusher, the vanilla creamier, and the oud richer and smoother than ever before. A holy grail for oud and gourmand lovers alike, Oud Satin Mood Extrait might be the most deliciously sensual scent to ever emerge from Francis Kurkdjian's magical workshop."," Agarwood, Bulgarian rose, benzoin, Turkish rose, violet and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49874.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Woman in Gold Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," The Austrian Mona Lisa glows not with an ambiguous smile, but in gorgeous golden patterns, motifs, and flushed rosy cheeks. Gustav Klimt's 1907 portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is one of the most famous of his erotic gold-leaf paintings. By Kilian's Woman In Gold conjures a similar sensuality and play between light and shadow through a delicate rose as seen through unctuous vanilla and exquisite woods. Woman in Gold glows from the onset, with a tart bergamot and ripe mandarin, blended into soft-focus by a warm vanillic tonka bean. A sweet silken rose slowly blooms, petals lifting, whipped to a velvety froth, but with a darkness within, hinted at by gentle layers of oud and patchouli, seamlessly adjoined. The result is a perfume as complex and dazzling as the woman who wears it."," bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Knight Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Inspired by the dashing, golden-armored chevalier in Gustav Klimt's 1902 Beethoven Frieze, By Kilian's Gold Knight flows with a similar golden opulence. The dark sensuousness of patchouli is draped in deep, golden honey, as Kilian Hennessy is wont to do. But despite the gourmand connotations, a fresh anisic bite adds an invigorating masculine edge for the Gold Knight - most distinctively paired with a bright, dry bergamot in the opening. As the scent grows darker, the honeyed patchouli shimmers with cinnamon, vanilla, and anise into a warm, sexy powerhouse.A magnificent collector's edition coffret, beautifully embellished in homage to artist Gustav Klimt's unique signature style and masterful use of gold leaf. Once opened, the mirrored zamac lid inside reflects the luminosity, mysterious glamour, and jewel-like quality of each bottle."," Bergamot, anise, patchouli, vanilla, cinnamon and honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau My Soul Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," While the internet can be a nasty, spiteful, ungenerous place (to say the very least), we're delighted to report that fragrance lovers, by and large, are the exact opposite- which explains the success of many supportive, loving private communities of perfume aficionados online, including Christi Long's Eau My Soul. To celebrate this island of positivity, 4160's Sarah McCartney offered EMS's members a rare chance- vote on their top 25 favorite notes, and she would blend them together into a magnum opus of fragrance. Lo and behold, the votes were cast, and Sarah delivered with Eau My Soul, the newest and most democratic of releases from 4160 Tuesdays.Working primarily from sandalwood and amber, the top two vote-getters, Eau My Soul is an exuberant delight, or as Sarah herself describes it, a ""warm, friendly, inclusive group hug"" of a scent. A fresh bust of early citrus quickly warms into smooth, creamy woods and amber, giving off the delectable vibe of sparkling root beer. As lush florals blend seamlessly with musk, tobacco and honeyed leather, we can't help but think of sinking into a well-worn easy chair in our favorite pajamas, warmed by an unpretentiously casual mixed drink and a bite of our favorite dessert. We know Eau My Soul is named for the community that launched it. But even if it weren't, the name fits too well to think it could be called anything else."," Bergamot, lavender, honey, frankincense, cognac, sandalwood, rose, jasmine, orris, myrrh, tobacco, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, benzoin, musk, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Berlin Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," It's Berlin - think carefree summers, swimming at the Strandbad Wannsee with fresh water hitting the skin. Gritty urban living in brutalist apartment blocks, concrete, elegant parquet floors. Modern bohemians in leather, smoke, spices, cups of black tea, inside and underground. A city where you can be decadent, poor-but-sexy. Berlin is a play of light and dark, opening with zingy top notes of grapefruit, clementine, and lemon, all the rinds glistening with oils. There's a zip from schinus molle – a piquant flushed fruit akin to pink pepper. An airy black tea leads the transition from the spicy-fresh to the darker underbelly of cedarwood and Haitian vetiver. Perfectly disheveled with a level of edge, Gallivant's Berlin transports you to the defiant, provocative heart of the city."," Grapefruit, clementine, lemon, schinus molle co2 extract, black pepper, black tea, Haitian vetiver, cedarwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pink Wood Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," Imagine the majestic web of roots beneath the ground's surface - the entwining rhizomatic structure, flowing energy deep from the earth. Tanya Bochnig, the natural perfumer of April Aromatics, has created an ode to these roots with Pink Wood, a regal blend that taps the root extracts and botanicals from plants growing close to the earth.Pink Wood unfurls dramatically with rose, the queen of flowers as Sappho called her, making her grand entrance in grand doses, in the form of rose absolute and rose otto. The rose feels warm and generous, honeyed around the edges with tart, sweet pink fruits and buttressed by a spiced bourbon-like oakwood. A dignified oud partners with the rose, but it's never overwhelming - in fact, a beautifully aged patchouli and radiant sandalwood smooth out all the edges, as cistus and labdanum expand with earthy darkness. Above all else, this is a grounding scent, teaching us that the heart and roots are not so separate after all."," Rose otto, rose absolute, geranium, pink fruits, rosewood, sandalwood, agarwood, patchouli, cistus, labdanum, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
El Cosmico Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," El Cosmico is both a difficult, and an easy, place to explain. On the one hand, it's almost impossible to succinctly describe this campground-turned-venue-turned-hotel-turned-landmark, or the remote, artists'-haven town of Marfa where it resides. On the other hand, when you're sitting around a roaring fire under the West Texas stars, it's simple to pick a single word: magical. This is at the core of David Moltz's El Cosmico, an ode to a truly remarkable place where the rustically timeless and the bleeding edge of hip coexist in beautiful harmony. Originally conceived for a 2015 performance where a proprietary olfactory instrument circulated scents throughout an outdoor crowd while his band performed, Moltz has since synthesized that experience into a single fragrance that perfectly captures the aura of the high plains desert: citric sumac plays against darkly smoky creosote and a zing of mesquite, while robustly fresh pinyon pine and oak lend a woodsy backbone. Above it all floats an enchanting, gently sparkling, and almost ozonic note- perhaps the sand accord?- that perfectly evokes the astounding glow of the stars out far beyond any city lights. Suspended between the luminous cosmos and the rugged frontier, El Cosmico is a delightful, surprising, enchanting new scent from D.S. & Durga."," Sumac, creosote, pinyon pine, oak, mesquite, sand, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68627.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"O, Unknown! Eau de Parfum",Imaginary Authors," ""There is no greater joy in the world than the joy of not knowing what is to be found around the bend."" - Philip SavaAt age 65, when famed explorer and author Philip Sava was given less than a year to live, he set off from his home in Madagascar for parts unknown. Leaving all his belongings behind, he set off on foot, hopped a freighter across the Indian Ocean, and wandered into the Bangladesh wilderness. His journey, which lasted over a decade, took him through Nepal and Tibet where his exploration turned spiritual and into rural China where months of solitude resulted in some of the most confessional observations ever committed to paper. This is the story of a man grappling with the meaning of life as he grasps to life's last vestiges.At the risk of sounding bleak, this night could be your last. Splash on O, Unknown! and plunge forth - the black tea leaves are swirling with ambiguous meanings, imbued with a light smokiness from Lapsang Souchong.

Like a transformative tea reading for your spirit."," Black tea, Lapsang Souchong tincture, orris butter, Kyoto moss, musk balsam, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Extrait de Parfum,Jeroboam," Taking on an olfactory family this well known is no small feat. It's a testament of perfumer Vanina Murraciole's originality and creativity that Ambra manages to whisk amber away from the staid and into a sensual, modern, androgynous realm. From the onset, Ambra enters a billowing vanilla, full of sweet cream and lifted up with a peppery-fresh duo of bergamot and geranium. It's fluffy, almost airy -- but there's a darkness around the edges, discreetly smoldering with patchouli and incense. Once Peru balsam kicks in, it's a veritable amber, but shape-shifting, nonetheless. Wrapped in the seductive energy of Jeroboam's enigmatic musks, with hints of of smoke in the distance, this amber on the brink of gourmand might just tip us over."," Bergamot, geranium, incense, peru balsam, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, enigmatic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cafe Tuberosa Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," Encountering CafÃ© Tuberosa is like entering a bustling coffeeshop, with that dark, bittersweet scent of freshly roasted coffee beans, grinding and pressed for a perfect cup of espresso.  The mouthwatering citrus that Atelier Cologne famously perfected is present in small doses here – just enough Calabrian bergamot to whet the tongue, and a ripe, tangy Sicilian tangerine that adds a wonderful fruity quality to an otherwise deep, warm cacao. In fact, the combination of rich cacao, classic espresso, and cardamom-flecked vanilla puts CafÃ© Tuberosa squarely in the gourmand category. And when Atelier Cologne does gourmand, they do it with subtlety and flair, and the proof is in the pudding. For despite its name, CafÃ© Tuberosa contains no high-powered tuberose, and the florals here are quite relaxed – it's the vanilla espresso combo that keeps us sniffing for more. Add the faintest hint of a cigarette, dangling from a coy smile, and you've got the most easy going kind of sexy scent, ready for whatever the day might bring."," Calabrian bergamot, Sicilian tangerine, Guatemalan cardamom, Indian tuberose, cacao absolute, rose absolute, Indonesian patchouli, Madagascar vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51035.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
My Own Private Teahupo'o Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," Teahupo'o, on the Tahitian coast- a place of unmatched beauty and untamed nature, where waves that begin as droplets of water in Antarctica gather power over thousands of miles before crashing ashore with such majestic power that the village has become perhaps the holiest- and most dangerous- site in international surfing. To commemorate this uniquely Tahitian fusion of intensity and tranquility, Carlos Kusubayashi enlisted the S-Perfume team to create My Own Private Teahupo'o, an exhilarating, intense oceanic scent with a surprisingly soothing development. Opening with a blast of salty ozone that drops us immediately onto the side of one of Teahupo'o's iconic 20-foot vertical waves, the scent instantly thrums with sensual energy. As we finally get around to catching our breath on shore, the ocean-kissed wind brings us the sweet essence of tropical flowers, while a smooth, creamy vanilla calls to mind a traditional monoi. Finally, the glow of IFF's renowned Amber Xtreme in the drydown leaves us feeling the sun on our skin long after dusk. Inspired by the ""calm origins and thrilling ends"" of Tahiti's most infamous waves, My Own Private Teahupo'o is a summertime escape- no matter the season."," Sea salt, ozone, frangipani, salicylates, Tahitian vanilla bean, Amber Xtreme",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kai Rose - Eau de Parfum Eau de Parfum Spray,Kai," Kai is a true phenomenon unlike any other, known for the lush yet clean scent of gardenia, effortlessly captivating. This newly developed scent is Kai's fresh take on the classic rose, and as one would expect, blooms gorgeously on skin.Kai Rose is no old-fashioned tea rose, nor is it brooding - instead, imagine the platonic ideal of a fresh, romantic rose, vibrant and deep pink. Now wrap it in Kai's signature luscious, exotic white flowers, and what was at once familiar and lovely feels like a new encounter all over again. Precious rose absolute and all-natural essences embody the philosophy of kai: breath, life, flow.

Mosaic Eau de Parfum,Mosaic," Just as artists combine individual geometric tiles to form a sprawling work mesmerizing tessellation in the Zellige style, Mosaic Eau de Parfum combines some of North and Western's Africa's most fragrant raw ingredients, all beautifully accessible on their own, into something opulent, complex and otherworldly.Mosaic opens with a heady dry oud, tinged with hints of apple and cherry tobacco. As the cool, spicy oud mellows, it mingles with a heart of authentic, lush vanilla. Earthy notes of cedar, sandalwood and musk ground the base as they softly emerge throughout the dry-down. The ultimate effect is something rich, warm and romantic."," Vanilla, oud, musk, cedarwood and sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elysium Pour Homme Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Drawn from Greek legend, the Elysian Fields are the eternal reward of the heroic and virtuous, a heaven accessible only to those of the highest character and accomplishment. With such lofty inspiration as background, and the sophisticated opulence of Roja Dove in control, we were expecting great things from Elysium. Now that we've smelled its fresh, warm, confident blend of musks, fruits, leather and woods, we're delighted to confirm that it's destined to become a new masculine classic. From the opening notes, it's clear that Elysium was designed to stand out, as it features a uniquely engineered use of musk as a top note, which combines with the ultra-fresh blend of energetic citrus and aromatic lavender for a beginning as smooth as it is fresh. A juicy, sweet dose of fruit in the heart pairs perfectly with spicy woods, balancing striking liveliness with richly masculine sophistication. And in the exquisite drydown, sensual leather and soft vanilla give strength and longevity while a reprise of musk lends a dreamlike warmth that more than lives up to the ambitious name. Like the Elysian Fields themselves, one must prove himself worthy of a fragrance this outstanding. But for those who are deserving, Elysium is a reward unlike any other."," Lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, lime, lavender, thyme, artemisia, musk, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmine, apple, blackcurrant, galbanum, pink pepper, cypriol, vetiver, cedarwood, juniper, benzoin, vanilla, labdanum, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74836.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Forget your head-shop fears of olde, as the opening of Velvet Haze is love-at-first-sniff: Sweet coconut milk laced with chocolate, a hint of leafy green freshness, all wrapped up in a cloud of fluffy musks. Gradually, the patchouli comes to the forefront, but it's layered with the sweet milk of childhood memories, a lick of delicious chocolate, dewy tropical flowers, and the merest hint of smoke.

Suede Osmanthe Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," When Pierre Guillaume reworks a fragrance, he does so from the bottom up – if L'Eau de Circe was his fruity paeon to the peachy osmanthus, Suede Osmanthe is its dark, mysterious cousin whose true identity is in question. Osmanthus is a most bewitching flower, its elegant petals often scenting the rice fields of China with their potently smoky, fruity fragrance. In Suede Osmanthe, the delicate flower's seductive contrasts are deconstructed and magnified to gorgeous effect.The first surprise comes in the fresh, lilting fizz of aldehydes - herbaceously floral and soapy-clean, the bubbles float and tug at the surface of a just-ripened apricot, and the fuzzy skin lets out small whiffs of the sweet fruit within. In a most natural transition, apricot skin melts into soft, cozy suede, and leathery Suederal radiates with the black tea leaves in a smoky embrace. The notes suddenly ring perfectly of a sleek osmanthus, slimmed down to its essentials. The illusion completes itself in a wave of silky musks, androgynous and mysterious. It's a chic illusion, as there's no actual osmanthus here, but as with the most beautiful sleight-of-hand, you'll fall in love anyway."," Aldehydes, black tea, osmanthus, apricot, Suederal, Cashmeran, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34553.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Sublime Elixir de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," In keeping with the legacy of Nicolai, Patchouli Sublime elevates the most classic material used in perfumery, patchouli, and reveals its sumptuous qualities, both verdant and smooth. Patchouli Sublime's appeal is in how the exquisite blend unfolds, starting from its high-altitude crisp beginning. If we were to compare it to its predecessor, Patchouli Intense, we would call them cousins – one of the earth, one of the sky.  Minty and green, a fresh lavender sets a classic stage for Patchouli Sublime, sparkling from its mountaintop. The pure, cool air, lifted with mint and coriander, introduces a dance of rosy geranium and soft, herbaceous patchouli to the scene. It's a regal pairing, and Parfums de Nicolai celebrates this time-honored union to, dare we say, sublime perfection. The patchouli never goes earthy, and instead, unfurls into a richly green, textured symphony, with the lavender in tow, all the way to the heart. The complexity and longevity of Patchouli Sublime reigns supreme, and as it melts into the skin, it's actually musky. And for once, Patchouli Sublime joins the mortal souls in their corporeal delights, and graces us with a clean yet gorgeously earthy, sensual musk. We couldn't imagine a classic tale better told."," Lavender, mint, coriander, geranium, rose, tonka bean, tobacco,  patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31357.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tubereuse Absolue Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Tuberose,  tuberose – what can we say about the belle of the ball? When she enters,  all eyes are on the sultry white flower in one fell swoop. With TubÃ©reuse Absolue,  Perris Monte Carlo follows the flower to her origin,  the Aztec civilization. There,  she was called Oximochitl,  or“bone flower, ” for her long white blossoms and delicate waxy petals. TubÃ©reuse Absolue pays tribute to the grand dame and the lineage of perfumery inspired by her charms. A fanfare of bright spices announces her arrival,  with cardamom leading the way,  and a glint of bergamot and lavender provide the spotlight. A grand tuberose,  long white petals sweeping the floor,  makes her radiant entrance,  gracious yet coy. Her intoxicating aroma is a slow reveal here,  and she keeps her indolic cards close to her chest. Handmaids jasmine and gardenia are by her side,  but they know never to overshadow the star. This is a most sophisticated tuberose,  not green or minty,  but clean,  luminous and creamy,  with enough woodsy richness to steal your heart. As her luscious white petals unfold,  they impart an almost suede-like buttery texture,  and a base of warm cedarwood shows just how deep her beauty goes. How could we resist“la belle dame sans merci” – the beautiful lady without mercy?"," Bergamot, cardamom, lavender, galbanum, tuberose, broom, jasmin sambac, gardenia, orange blossom, cedar, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70211.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elephant Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Huge trees quake at their approach, vulnerable leaves shuddering as the ground rumbles under heavy footsteps. They come with appetites as massive as their lumbering bodies. Nothing is spared from their bottomless hunger – trees stripped bare, roots upturned, even the tiniest blooms cannot escape their grasp. When the behemoths move on, they leave behind a path of destruction. Yet what often looks like carnage is actually a renaissance. The elephants fulfill a vital role- purging the delicate ecosystem, allowing new life to flourish.From beneath a canopy of lush, damp foliage, the complex aromas of Zoologist Elephant emerge. Into a mixture of invigorating Darjeeling and incense, swirl hints of magnolia, coconut and cocoa. With the patience of a foraging herd stripping the bark from a thicket of trees, the fragrance dissipates gradually. What is revealed is the core of the perfume - a beautiful and satisfying blend of woody notes, which dry down to an elegant, natural sandalwood scent."," Tree leaves, Darjeeling tea, magnolia, cocoa, coconut milk, incense, jasmine, woody notes, amber, musks, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Layton EXCLUSIF Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," When we first heard that Parfums de Marly had a new version of their cult favorite Layton, we admit we were at a bit of a loss: how could they possibly improve on the fruity, spicy, gloriously lively luxuriousness of this ode to the splendor of Versailles? Now that we have it in our hands, we're pleased to announce this is no mere flanker. Instead, perhaps inspired by Marie Antoinette's extensive remodeling of the palace and grounds in the 18th century, Marly has rebuilt Layton from the ground up, delivering a companion piece to the fresh, sporty original that surrounds the signature blend of fruits and spices with deep, animalic woods and resins for a darkly seductive experience. In Layton Exclusif, a heavy dose of civet hums through the rich floral heart, delivering a new layer of sensuality. And the already opulent vanilla and woods base is further enhanced, with resinous amber and an alluringly powerful coffee note to invigorate the senses and heighten the passion. Does Layton Exclusif take the place of our beloved Layton? It's not meant to. Instead, we think of the two as the ultimate pair- Layton, a gentleman's perfect match for a day of royal festivities, and Layton Exclusif, a dangerously seductive secret weapon when day turns to evening."," Bergamot, mandarin, water accord, grapefruit, rose, geranium, waterlily, gardenia, civet, cardamom, sandalwood, gaiac, amber, pink pepper, vanilla, coffee, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Wood Intense Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," In celebration of the 10th anniversary of Oud Wood, a game-changer in its use of oud for Western perfumery, Tom Ford has come out with a confident, commanding new take with Oud Wood Intense. If you're expecting the same old song but with a different tune, you'll be pleasantly, outrageously surprised – it's no flanker here. Indeed, with the higher extrait concentration, the amped-up rugged texture is entirely its own doing, with a fresh new set of notes.Don't undermine that word Intense – the supercharged fragrance opens with a zingy, hydrating burst of aromatics and spices with the addition of piquant cypress, juniper, and angelica root. They combine for an almost citrus-like sweet fresh energy, but always with a slightly bitter, verdant edge. Then, at the heart of Oud Wood Intense, we reach the growling, meaty heart. Layers of ginger add spice while Tom Ford's signature smooth oud sings, but don't be fooled – this is the most prominently smoky, textured oud of his yet. The castoreum contributes a wonderfully animalic dimension that adds heft and presence akin to Tuscan Leather, but even surpassing it in dark, saturated presence. One of the most exciting additions to the Tom Ford Private Blend line, Oud Wood Intense is a bold statement to add polish to any night out on the town."," Angelica root, ginger, cypress, juniper, oud, castoreum Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Oud Wood Intense by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Patch Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville," Patch Flash is one of the most exuberant ""Flashes"" yet. Its mouthwatering opening is shaped by a bracing whisky accord - bright and boozy, but with a rich earthiness and a touch of smoke. As it dries down, the juiciness gives way to a drier spiciness in the heart. Eventually, everything settles to a velvety, golden amber on a cool, dark patchouli - a deep viridian green.There something achingly autumnal about the contrast of golden warmth and cool depth in Patchouli Flash. It's like that feeling on the last warm afternoon of fall, kicking through a pile of raked leaves to the damp grass and cool earth beneath. A must-sniff for patchouli fans and newcomers alike."," Spices, Whiskey Accord, Leather, Patchouli, Benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69209.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Figment Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," A new release from Amouage is always reason to celebrate, but when a fragrance as unique as Figment arrives, we can truly appreciate just how special the venerable Omani house can be. Rich with contrast, dreamlike in its serenity, Figment Man draws exquisite florals, woods and animalics together to create an utterly original, rapturously imaginative men's scent that will challenge and delight in equal measure. Opening with fresh, tranquil notes of lemon, geranium, and pink pepper, Figment then moves into a luminous heart of sandalwood that entwines dramatically with leather-inflected, smokily animalic elements evoking primal secrets and ancient traditions. As the base emerges, intoxicatingly balsamic strokes of labdanum and guaiac wed the earthly to the mystical with sublime grace. Inspired by the wondrous Kingdom of Bhutan, where the mountains meet the sky, Figment Man is an apt testament to one of the few places on earth where magic and mystery still reign."," Lemon, geranium, pink pepper, sandalwood, animalic accord, vetiver, labdanum, guaiac, earth accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41886.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champs de Provence Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," A new Eight and Bob scent is more than just a fragrance; it's a voyage to through the early 20th century's most beautiful and glamorous locales, through the eyes of perfumer and aristocrat Albert Fouquet. With Champs de Provence, Fouquet whisks us away to a charming stretch of French countryside, where Europe's rich and beautiful leave the bustle of city life behind to unwind in rustic villas, surrounded by the beautiful abundance of nature in full bloom. And full bloom is exactly what this delightfully fresh, disarmingly casual scent delivers. Featuring a sumptuous bouquet of crisp, juicy fruits and wonderfully lush florals, held together with a surprisingly sexy base of musk and mate, Champs de Provence lets us feel like we're strolling through an untouched meadow, the heat of the midday sun unlocking the aromas of the thousands of wild plants native to this unspoiled paradise. With its intoxicating freshness, it's the perfect casual gentlemen's scent- but we have no doubt that it would smell every bit as stunning on a lady with a taste for the great outdoors."," Bergamot, orange, pear, jasmine, rose, orange blossom, musk, mate, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63907.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sunny Side Up Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Leave it to iconoclast Juliette Has A Gun to infuse sandalwood with exuberant new optimism, out of the darkness and into the golden sun. In a pop art flourish, the yolky marigold cap on the white bottle cheekily alludes to its name, Sunny Side Up - but worry not - it's meant as a symbol of carefree joy, and the scent is as sleek as silk on skin. In the first moment of Sunny Side Up, fresh, sweet cream of amyris and sandalwood enters the senses, and it feels like when the warm light of the afternoon sun bathes the skin. Smooth, pure, and milky, the sandalwood comes across as lovely as homemade ice cream, with delightful specks of vanilla bean, elevated with a drizzle of coconut milk. Hints of jasmine add air and lift, with thick, luxurious slabs of iris butter blended deliciously in, resulting in a never-heavy, freshly-whipped finish. Sunny Side Up charmingly glides along between the beachy, gourmand, and woodsy, without ever staying put in any one category. As the holiday in the sun winds down, layers of soft musk wrap around creamy pear-like ambrette and warm vanilla in the coziest finale. A masterpiece that is bound to bring a smile to your face."," Amyris, vanilla, sandalwood, iris butter, jasmine, ambrette, Iso E Super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40129.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monsieur Beauregard Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"“Our French friend” is how this unknown but over-familiar houseguest Monsieur Beauregard is typically introduced. His lingering gaze lets you know he'll take things from here. A special kind of perfection that with its strong caressing silence speaks volumes! Confidently quiet, and mysteriously sexy, Monsieur Beauregard's namesake fragrance opens with subtle vivacity, a silky burst of pink pepper, lemon, and spicy cinnamon. But this dashing young French heir never gives it all away – the veil of mystery is always there, in a creamy base of orris and enough woodsy musk to make your knees weak. The warm benzoin and tonka is downright seductive, with the most French allure we've seen out of the Penhaligons Portraits series. Masculine, musky, and sexy, it's a statement made in one dramatic glance – one look is all it takes."," Lemon, pink pepper, orris, cinnamon, benzoin, sandalwood, tonka bean, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Uncompromising Sohan Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Ambitious, intelligent and astute, Sohan has worked diligently with flair and talent to establish himself in the world of affairs. Although he may be uncompromising in his drive, he certainly knows how to transform his business relationships into amicable ties; Lord George and Lady Blanche are always thrilled to welcome a well-traveled, worldly guest. His fragrance is that of a thoroughly unfamiliar rose – a rose with oversized thorns. A juicy, tangy rose that knows nothing of coy discretion, for it is paired with a powerful, yet refined oud that knows when to charge onward. But ever the diplomat, Sohan's oud knows how to charm and negotiate between his Middle Eastern associates and the Western palate, with the perfect amount of musky vetiver to ground the whole discussion. The gifts of pink pepper and saffron don't hurt, nor does the smoothing effect of creamy sandalwood. The Uncompromising Sohan makes a confident, distinctive statement with ease and elegance."," Rosebud, pink pepper, saffron, labdanum, vetiver, sandalwood, Laos oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Bewitching Yasmine Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," The Bewitching Yasmine is by all appearances soft and quiet. Yet at the same time, she conducts herself with a rare force. Some, the less determined, would find her distant, maybe cold, but appearances are notoriously misleading. Like many intriguing (and bewitching) women, the perfume of Yasmine is hot and cold. The unique sharpness of rich, strong coffee is set off against a creamy spice accord, complete with aromatic cardamom. Hers is an ambition that doesn't look back, and she has the allure to match - billowing white vanilla, honeyed with hints of jasmine catch your attention. As you lean in for more, a wisp of incense floats away, with a mysterious note of Laotian oud. The  Bewitching Yasmine is a rare beauty with a a one-way ticket, and if you're lucky, you'll be the one to fall under her charm."," Cardamom, coffee, jasmine sambac, incense, white vanilla, Tahitian vanilla, Laos oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Ruthless Countess Dorothea Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," The Ruthless Countess Dorothea is a most ferocious matriarch, known for her sharp mind, even sharper wit and a secret fondness for the company of young men and scones! She knows how to host and receive, with impeccable manners, without question. And her scent is similarly refined, reassuring – but you can't help but notice the surreptitious flame. She opens with  a hit of uplifting citrus bergamot that recalls the finest Earl Grey tea. Drink deeper, and you notice the honeyed spice in the air, with red ginger and cinnamon. It's deliciously wearable, with an inviting, creamy vanilla like buttery scones at tea-time. But don't get too comfortable - the furtive glances belie the cozy gourmands - for it seems there's some sherry in the tea and always, the potential of new romance."," Bergamot, red ginger, cinnamon, beeswax, clary sage, mate, vanilla, sherry, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terroni Parfum,Orto Parisi," Inspired by the molten lava that bubbles beneath the earth's surface and has shaped the once-volcanic terrain of southern Italy, Terroni is an intense, fiery fragrance for those with passion for their roots. Bursting with ferocious doses of spice, earth and deep, musky woods, this is an Orto Parisi through and through. There's something powerful and fulfilling about putting your hands in the soil, the sense of belonging to the Earth- and Terroni is, foremost, a fragrance that celebrates that earth in all of its power and pedigree. The world began with an explosion- and now with Terroni, that explosion can be worn.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetyverio - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," The elegant balance between the fresh and earthy as achieved in Vetyverio is brought to a new, more powerful level in this Eau de Parfum concentration. The legendary percentage of Haitian vetiver (ethically sourced, no less) at 25% is again present here, but with a dynamic new presence due to the increased concentration. We were blown away by the deeper, woodsier base notes that made the vetiver feel true-to-life, along with a boosted grapefruit opening that sings effervescently and highlights vetiver's fresh, herbaceous quality. The result is an incredible ode to vetiver that is deeply naturalistic, and revels in its contrasts, both invigorating and grounding, with a bold new projection and sillage. And, it being Diptyque, there's always a playful charm - in this case, a surprising note of rose, if you can catch it."," Haitian vetiver, patchouli, grapefruit, Turkish rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aventus For Her Eau de Parfum,Creed," Aventus for Her marks the irresistible feminine counterpart to the legendary Aventus.

The Aventus for Her spirit lives in every woman; she is poised with inner strength and radiance, and leaves an indelible mark on all she touches.

Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," In the Fall of 2014, Baccarat, the most prestigious and opulent crystalworks in the world, celebrated the 250th anniversary of their founding by releasing an extraordinary crystal decanter containing a luminous, exclusive fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian. Released later onto the open market in a slightly more achievable presentation as Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP, the world quickly fell in love with the gorgeously woody floral-amber and its equal parts transparent, dense, and intense character. Now, Baccarat and M. Kurkdjian extend their partnership with a new Extrait concentration that intensifies the power and radiance of all aspects of the scent, all without betraying the original inspiration.MFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The ""breeze"" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling ""heat"" accord. Finally, a ""mineral"" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. Each accord is given new strength in Extrait form, harmonizing above the skin with a stunning new power and intensity. Like a crystalline kaleidoscope, the Extrait opens brighter, fruitier, and shinier, and, we've found, lasts long into the wild night. Furthermore, for the first time, the scent dons a dazzling red bottle that echoes the iconic Baccarat red, giving a bold yet classic new look to Francis Kurkdjian's greatest achievement yet."," Egyptian jasmine grandiflorum, saffron, Moroccan bitter almond, cedar, musky wood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49873.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Histoire D'Orangers Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," This newest offering from L'Artisan Parfumeur is a radiant tribute to the perfumer Marie Salagmagne's travels in the valley of Souss, at the foothills of the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. Remembering the sunset atop the earth walls of the Taroudant, the warm light intensifying the colors of the raw land, she remarks,“Each time I think of this majestic landscape, I think of orange tree flower water. A delicate and delicious water, ultra-refreshing and incredibly luminous.”Histoires D'Orangers is truly a story of oranges sublimated into a most delicate and pure flower water. From its sparkling white tea and verdant neroli beginning, to the gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed in glistening mineral ambroxan, it is a gentle, exquisite fragrance, through and through. There's much to revel in, when the subtleties are revealed - whether it's the musk that achieves a triple-milled purity that's never overtly soapy, or the light almond-like hint of tonka beans – the end result is like a feeling more than anything – like silk on skin, warmed by the sun."," Neroli, orange blossom, white tea, musk, tonka bean, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Au Bord De L'Eau Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Inspired by the signature work of Claude Monet, Au Bord de l'Eau uses raw olfactive materials as if they were paint pigments. Contours are suggested, not defined, in the watery waves.Like Monet's masterpiece, we alternate between the realism of the zest of bergamot and lemon - its freshness is mixed with the petals of the bitter orange - and the more complex texture nestled below. The mist of sparkling citrus rests on the green and woody undertones of rosemary, violet, and soft musk. A cologne painted in pointillism."," Bergamot, lemon, violet, musk, orange blossom, rosemary",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Scarlet Lily Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," Warm and voluptuous, Scarlet Lily is Shay & Blue's gorgeous new take on the deep red flower. This is a heady bouquet, its light, airy beginning accentuated with lotus blossoms creating a dewy mist. But when we get to the heart, it's all undulating lilies - creamy, waxy, and regal. The petals of the scarlet Adriadne lily flutter in the air, never too indolic or heavy, with an intriguing hint of woodsy spice from a touch of ylang-ylang. In many ways, Scarlet Lily is a feat in subtle textures, finally melting into the skin in a gorgeous, gentle amber finish. Like the most benevolent seduction in a twilight bloom."," Lotus blossom, scarlet Ariadne lily, ylang ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70417.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Delina Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Composed by Guerlain-trained perfumer Quentin Bisch, Delina is a floral bouquet, a fragrant tribute to feminity and sensuality. Housed in a gorgeously soft pink bottle with pink tassels to boot, the polished, delicate character is apparent from the beginning. It opens brightly with sweet, juicy lychee and softly tangy rhubarb, but these tart fruits aren't sharp in the least, and serve only to provide lift with a wink. It is the posh lily of the valley, regal Turkish rose, and fresh peony that form the beautiful feminine heart. Creamy and undulating with vanilla and white musk, Delina is flawlessly blended to soft, sumptuous delight."," Bergamot, lychee, rhubarb, nutmeg, Turkish rose, vanilla, musk, Haitian vetiver, cedar, frankincense, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The Cora Eau de Parfum,Thameen," The Cora Sun-Drop Diamond, discovered in 2010 in South Africa, is the largest yellow pear-shaped diamond in the world, weighing in at an astounding 110.3 carats. Distinguished by its gorgeously vivid yellow hue, the result of nitrogen trapped in the carbon molecules while it was forming billions of years ago, the diamond sold to an anonymous bidder for almost $11 million. While the otherworldly beauty of the Cora Sun-Drop is sadly no longer for sale, Thameen has given us the next best thing, a stunning floral amber that radiates both bright excitement and luxurious elegance. The Cora opens with a sparkling flash of white jasmine and magnolia, shining against sweet wisteria and luscious yellow Bulgarian rose. Like the perfectly cut edge of a worthy stone, a precisely applied dash of nutmeg contrasts with a generous swoon of carnation and lily and a rich ribbon of creamy vanilla that swirls with resinous notes to make a delectable amber. Shining with dazzling brightness, suffused with profound beauty, The Cora is a gorgeously feminine scent for those with a taste for the finest in life."," Bulgarian Rose, jasmine, wisteria, magnolia, carnation, nutmeg, vanilla, lily of the valley, benzoin, patchouli, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73415.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandala Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," Mandala is an old Sanskrit word for circle that, in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism, has come to mean a feeling of completeness. When Tibetan monks make a mandala offering, they are offering up the universe in a microcosm to Buddha. Thus it follows that Mandala, the fragrance, offers up the gift of every precious material that monks possess to the Gods – frankincense, myrrh, ambergris, and precious spices. The scent opens with the dark, coca cola effervescence of ebony woods, frankincense, and myrrh, immediately flooding the soul with a sense of reverence and peace. At once exotic and atmospheric, one can almost feel cool stone at one's back and hear the low chant of the monks. But despite the rich density of resin and spice, the scent feels weightless and airy. The peppery incense floats over a cool, soapy canopy of cardamom and angelica, which parts to reveal not a church ceiling but the open night sky. A trace of saline moss and ambergris in the base steadies the resins and spices, fixing them in a verdant earthiness that feels solid, grounded. Mandala is Eastern Zen in a bottle."," Nutmeg, angelica, olibanum (frankincense), cardamom, cinnamon, clove, labdanum, cedar, myrrh, sandalwood, oakmoss, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Qatar Extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," Roja Dove's tribute to Qatar focuses on ambergris, one of the rarest materials on earth, and presents it in all its luxurious richness. The fragrance opens with sumptuous waves of sweet, salty, musky, caramel ambergris infused with toffee'd labdanum, praline-scented benzoin, and creamy vanilla. As if to mimic Qatar's famous islands, Roja Dove then dots the golden ambered waters with a complex mix of the gourmand and the oriental: roses drenched in sweet peach, jammy patchouli, fiery saffron, delectable candy floss, plush orris, and a panoply of soft, creamy woods. They take turns dancing and weaving around the opulent golden core but, make no mistake, Qatar is a gourmand amber above all else, a feast for the senses that invites you to indulge in the perfume world's most sumptuous treasure with all the extravagant excess for which Roja Dove is renowned."," Citrus notes, rose de mai, jasmine from Grasse, violet, pear, peach, clove, saffron, patchouli, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, oud, candyfloss accord, benzoin, vanilla, orris sur cÃ¨dre, orris, styrax, birch, labdanum, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74833.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nuit de Bakelite Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," Alluring. That's the simplest way to describe Naomi Goodsir's latest masterpiece, Nuit de Bakelite, an otherworldly, intensely green interpretation of tuberose that's anything but simple. Drawing upon tuberose's most narcotic facets, perfumer Isabelle Doyen has crafted a stunningly bright, tantalizingly aromatic scent that ignites the senses and redefines what a floral fragrance can be. Nuit de Bakelite wastes no time announcing itself, as the very first sniff explodes with a nose-tingling burst of herbaceous angelica and bitter-green galbanum, softened with the earthy smoothness of violet leaf and an exquisite orris that recalls Naomi's equally wonderful Iris Cendre. This spiky-yet-soft dynamic is the perfect showcase for the rich tuberose heart- in Doyen's hands; the ""queen of the night"" is rich, lush and spicy, evoking a visceral carnality but never tilting too far into heavy, indolic territory. As it dries, a chorus of resinous notes and spiced tobacco draw out a vibrant portrait of floral leather, sensuous and still thrillingly green. We've always known that tuberose was among the most spectacular notes in perfumery, but even we had no idea just how beautifully original it still can seem-- until we experienced Nuit de Bakelite. We strongly suggest you do the same."," Angelica, violet leaf, galbanum, orris, karo karounde, tuberose, leather, davana, styrax, tobacco, labdanum, gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59305.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Neroli Ad Astra Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Uplifting and luminous, Neroli ad Astra (Neroli to the stars in Latin) more than lives up to its name, delivering a fresh white floral scent of lush romanticism and surprising resonance. Built around a rare and precious Moroccan neroli extract unparalleled in its honeyed depth, this newest addition in the ""Collection Rework"" may be Pierre Guillaume's floral masterpiece, the kind of scent that can make even the most jaded fragrance fan fall in love with neroli all over again.Neroli ad Astra opens with a fruity, spicy burst, layering a kick of pink pepper over a mouthwatering blend of pear and tangerine. As the Moroccan neroli, a particularly lush and floral extract, begins to assert itself, it's lifted by green, fresh agave blossom and warm, spicy geranium, and made even lusher with Egyptian jasmine. A smooth, fresh base of premium musks perpetuates the dreamlike atmosphere, drying down to a blissfully clean, softly sensual scent that smells utterly beautiful. Simultaneously lively and sexy, Neroli Ad Astra isn't just another neroli scent- it's a Neroli in a class of its own."," Pear, tangerine, pink pepper, neroli, agave blossom, geranium, vetiver, jasmine, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34552.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Midnight Special Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," In the enchanting world of traditional Arabian perfumery, a mukhallat is a perfume created from a blend of pure fragrance oils, perfected over centuries but still open to the creator's personal touch. With Midnight Special, Olivier Pescheux transposes the mukhallat to a more Parisian format- the eau de parfum- keeping the focus on exceptional natural materials, but re-imagining it as a nocturnal elixir, with traditional elements of oud, rose, patchouli and spice given a cosmopolitan twist with a unique accord of rose jelly. The results are dynamic- dark, sensually smoky oud and luscious florals shine through, but the mouthwatering jelly accord, with its strong grapefruit facets, invigorates and energizes the heart notes, making an ancient formula feel vitally youthful. And a deep, rich and evocative base of oud and smooth, balanced vanilla lasts for untold hours, ensuring that the wearer will be turning heads well into the morning. Exotic, stylish and drop dead sexy, Midnight Special is a cross-cultural knockout that may inspire you to do some nighttime mingling of your own."," Black pepper, cinnamon, saffron, rose, rose jelly accord, grapefruit, oud, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suede de Suede Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," A soft and supple suede scent that caresses the senses. Inspired by in-house perfumer Fredrik Dalman's memories of Sweden, this is a rich, but gentle, blend of wood, leather and musk, with delicate grace notes of flowers and berries. Dalman's vision began with a pair of gloves – suede worn to the point of silkiness, lined with fur – but this scent also reminds us of a fluffy eiderdown comforter on a winter night, providing perfect warmth without heaviness. The musk at the heart of this scent is the ideal balance of clean and sensuous – with the delicate sweetness of osmanthus highlighting the innocent aspects and deep cedarwood and earthy patchouli amplifying the less-innocent ones. Although cloudberry sounds like something that might grow on a magical island, it is a real fruit that grows in Scandinavia – an amber berry with a distinctive tart taste – and it provides an exquisite, cool airiness that counters the warm and creamy suede. Initially sultry, SuÃ¨de de SuÃ¨de softens to become deliciously cozy and inviting."," Cloudberry, Sichuan pepper, suede accord, cedarwood, osmanthus, strawberry leaf, castoreum, patchouli, precious musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51728.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dojima Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," DÃµjima opens with a delicious almond-like sweetness, which is intriguingly countered by a crisp and aromatic clary sage, setting the stage for a truly unusual scent. Tranquil and unique, DÃµjima is named for the Dojima Rice Exchange founded by Samurai in 1697, in Osaka, Japan and is a meditation on the perfect beauty of a grain of rice. A rice accord gives this fragrance its intriguing, hard-to- place quality – the subtle, milky warmth of steamed white rice is an undercurrent to a soothing cloud of rice powder laced with jasmine and orris. The deep sweetness of amber with a dash of nutmeg provides a rich and mellow base. An unexpected blend of edible and powdery notes that is both mysterious and comforting. A recipe to soothe the soul."," Rice accord, nutmeg absolute, ambrette, jasmine, orris, clary sage absolute, labdanum CO2, sandalwood, precious musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51729.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vitrum Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco," Vitrum is a simple but striking fragrance that showcases vetiver, its main star, in all its complex facets. This is a dramatically dark, top-quality vetiver that is gorgeously smoky, and laced with peaty, woody, mossy, earthy, and even salty fresh accents underneath. Cool, meditative incense is intertwined within, while touches of black pepper, crisp bergamot, and delicate, soft pink roses dance in the background. The notes shimmer around you, radiating different nuances in a way that lends an air of mystery and excitement to its star note. The result is an airy but strong and multi-faceted take on vetiver that is incredibly refined, smooth, and easy to wear. If you're a fan of the vetiver in Chanel's famous Sycomore, then Vitrum may steal your heart."," Vetiver, rose, black pepper, incense, bergamot, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bond-T Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco," Patchouli and chocolate lovers rejoice, because Bond-T will blow your mind with its mouthwatering, dark twist on the gourmand oriental category. Inspired by a visit to a top Italian chocolatier, Sammarco takes the richest black chocolate cake, slathers it in thick layers over a spicy, earthy, and woody patchouli, and then elevates everything to the next level by adding cognac liqueur, sweet plummy fruits, smoky tobacco, smooth leather, and a touch of expresso.  It's a head-turning scent that left us drooling from the first sniff, but the rest of the scent is equally delectable. The luscious darkness eventually turns into a soft golden dream of boozy patchouli enveloped in creamy vanilla and comforting amber. Bond-T is a must-try for patchouli lovers as well as fans of Serge Lutens' Borneo, Roja Dove's Enigma, Roja Dove's Amber Extrait, and dark chocolate fragrances."," Cocoa, patchouli, castoreum, tonka, vanilla, osmanthus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Naias Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco," Sammarco plays once more with classical and modern perfume styles in this beautifully original, playful fruity floral that caught our attention from the very first sniff with a bright, explosively tart, lip-smacking green apple note. It's lightly sweetened with pear juice and neroli, then poured over jammy red roses, violets, green violet leaf, and a vintage-style accord of lightly powdered iris and lipstick-smelling orris. The vintage elements slowly give way to a very modern darkness, thanks to smoky osmanthus leather that's been coated in amber resins, layered with buttery sandalwood, and licked by a touch of animalic muskiness. As it develops further, Naias turns into a chameleon, its soft notes weaving and dancing in the air, frequently changing, sometimes rippling out as a fruity floral leather, sometimes as a creamy irisy woody musk with amber, abstract flowers, tangy fruits, and powder woven in. It eventually finishes as a cashmere soft mix of caramel-scented amber, plush woods, and powdered sweetness. We love Naias for its seamless layering of contrasting elements and its effortless mix of genres-- but it's also a lot of fun and easy to wear-- we bet you'll enjoy Naias as much as we do!"," Violet, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, neroli, iris, sandalwood, apple, pear, cassis, mandarin, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Osmanthus is beautiful 365 days a year. But there's no denying that it really comes into its own in the summer heat, when it wears like the crispest white linen summer dress you've ever had the pleasure of putting on. Opening with a lively duo of bitter, greenish citrus and artemisia, the fragrance immediately establishes itself as a very clean, peppery, and invigorating citrusy floral. The osmanthus is there, half-hidden in the rustle of green muguet and leaves, but it is not overly ripe or fruity, instead emitting only delicate wisps of leathery apricot skin. The gently bitter citrus and herbs carry through to the heart, where the osmanthus melts into a radiant white jasmine, creating a gauzy, diaphanous floral effect akin to a flurry of moist petals settling on the surface of green water. And although the base gives us a bit of ambery woods for structure, the overall feel here is of a lively, cheerful floral brimming with pepper and citrus. But don't mistake freshness for banality! As flinty and delicious as a glass of chilled Sancerre, Osmanthus shows us just how intoxicating crisp, clean flowers can be when handled by the right hands."," Pomelo, artemisia, red pepper, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine sambac, cedar, labdanum resin, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ta'if Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ta'if roses have to hustle to survive in a hostile growing environment, high up on the plains of a rocky region near Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Mirroring its harsh environment, the Ta'if rose yields oil that is almost as extreme in its biting greenness and peppery spiciness. To complement its obstinate and proud character, Linda Pilkington chose to surround the rose with an array of exciting Arabian“flavors”, such as saffron and dates - the saffron adding a mysterious, iodine-like touch of leather, the dates adding a juicy sweetness that gives the texture a satisfying, toffee-like chew. Ta'if is simply breathtaking. At first sharp and spicy with pepper, the rose note soon emerges in all its pushy, exotic beauty, like a Ta'if rose itself erupting through the rocky, arid soil of the Mecca plains. Later dusted heavily with bitter saffron and softened with a soapy freesia, the rose relaxes into a comfortable, peachy tone that is as unexpected as it is joyful. Orange blossom and dates add a fudgy sweetness that nudges the rose towards a Persian sweetmeat, giving the fragrance a jellied lokhoum feel. Ta'if is never thick or leaden in its exotic sweetness, however, because little wafts of gorse bush-like broom cut through the ambered heft of the base to provide lift and air. A pleasure to wear and smell, Ta'if is a gust of authentic desert air, full of spicy rose, orange blossom, and honeyed Arabian treats. Try it and be transported to another world."," Saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tolu Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Tolu is that rare animal in perfumery: an oriental that won't have you gasping for air or reaching for an insulin pen. The reason it succeeds – and succeeds so gloriously – is because of its confident balance between the warmly resinous and the briskly herbal. Fresh, green clary sage and juniper berry infuse the creamy-sweet amber with gusts of air straight from the deepest pine forest. Orange blossom adds a thickly honeyed feel to the resin, but this is balanced immediately by a crisp muguet that illuminates everything with its cool, watery greenness. Tart frankincense and roses weave through the creamy, chocolatey tonka bean foundation, aerating it and making it a treat that satisfies completely but will never weigh you down.    It would be remiss of us not to mention Tolu's incredible versatility. Its plush, velvety depth make it perfectly suited to a night out in Paris or the opera; but its sunny warmth also lends itself most affably to snuggling with a loved one, or taking a long walk on cool Fall days, kicking over the amber-colored leaves. Tolu is the type of fragrance whose delicious-but-not-filling sweetness invites you to bury your nose in your coat collars and scarves to sniff out its lingering trail of gorgeousness."," Juniper berry, orange blossom, clary sage, orchid, Moroccan rose, muguet (lily of the valley), tolu balsam, tonka bean, golden frankincense, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Montabaco - Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Inspired by the rugged exoticism of the Argentinean plains, Montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3D picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. All this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with Iso E Super and Hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.A fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air. Although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, Montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. But the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. The result? A genuinely masculine“Gaucho” type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the Argentinean outback. The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," Air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Montabaco - Intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," Inspired by the rugged exoticism of the Argentinean plains, Montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3D picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. All this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with Iso E Super and Hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.A fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air.

Nawab of Oudh - Intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," Nawab of Oudh is, essentially, the spirit of a traditional Indian attar wrapped up in the format of a Western spray fragrance. Think a mass of jammy rose petals, fermented magnolia blossoms, and pandan leaf over a warm, spicy amber mercifully free of any vanilla that might weigh it down. The traditional Indian attar tends towards the lean and spicy rather than sweet or fatty, and this is a style carried through very faithfully to Nawab of Oudh.    For those afraid of oud, don't worry – in Nawab of Oudh, the oud note is there only to gild the other accords with a hint of something animalic, in much the same way as civet was used in classic French perfumery. The main body of this beautiful, majestic fragrance is that warm, salt leather amber wrapped around intensely fragrant rose petals, orange peel, and magnolia, with just a hint of the nobly-rotting wood of oud peeking through the slats every now and then. Richly braided and embroidered in the Indian tradition, Nawab of Oudh will make you feel like, well, a Nawab."," Green notes, bergamot, orange absolute, cardamom, aldehyde, rose, magnolia, orchid, pimento, bay, cinnamon, hedione, ambergris, musk, vetiver, labdanum, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Qi - Intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," Inspired by the Chinese symbol Qi (pronounced“Chi”), meaning ”˜breath of life', Ormonde Jayne's QI is a tribute to the aesthetic taste for delicacy that permeates Chinese culture from top to toe. Never intended to be a showy or dramatic fragrance, Qi instead reads as a light breeze carried from a cultivated Japanese garden, warmed through with hints of clean, tea-like florals and silky osmanthus petals. Qi opens with the balmy bite of neroli and lemon blossom, a delicately fresh precursor to a heart full of osmanthus, which laces the scent with a juicy, apricot-like aroma as well as the lightly tannic scent of green tea leaves. For a while, the scent floats peacefully along in this faintly peppered and fruited tea vein until a soft, mossy musk blurs the edges of the scent. Traversing all the minute stops between a fruity osmanthus oolong to a dry, green matÃ©, Qi is simply a must try for tea lovers, or indeed for anyone who values translucence and refinement above all.The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," Green lemon blossom, neroli, freesia, tea notes, osmanthus, violet, hedione, rose, mate, benzoin, musk, moss, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ambre Royal is a resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer is amplified in the base by the hot, salty rasp of ambergris. To wear it is to feel dipped in liquid gold and then rolled in fleurs de sel, the floral salt winnowed from the marshes of Brittany. Sappy green herbs and juicy orange announce the house signature, their peppery brightness sending a shaft of light through the structure, cheerfully prepping the way for the resins and flowers that follow. Behind the sparkle of the opening act, the soft creaminess of flowers beckons - a heart full of rosy, creamy orchid and the delicately leathery apricot of Chinese osmanthus. But caressed constantly by sweet, resinous amber and that woody-salty ambergris, the vibe is never overtly floral. The flowers exist mainly to fleck the molten red-gold warmth of the amber with little daubs of watery, dewy freshness, and ensure that the structure retains its luminous weightlessness. In the base, a duo of earthy, chocolatey patchouli and sweet, creamy tonka provide a dark contrast to the shimmering brightness of the top. A sophisticated, and yes, regal amber, it is the salty floral breeze running through Ambre Royal that positions it far away from the rough and tumble of the souk."," Green notes, orange absolute, bergamot, jasmine, orchid, osmanthus, rose, amber, orris, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champaca Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Centered on a green tea accord with a squeeze of zesty lemon, Champaca is as squeaky clean as a freshly-scrubbed face. It is especially good in hot weather, when the papery coolness of the neroli, bamboo, and green tea steps forward to soothe ruffled tempers and restore internal peace. Stirred into this frosty glass of ice tea is a scant teaspoon's worth of basmati rice: subtle but present, it provides just enough cloudy milkiness to take the sting out of the green tea.Champaca is unusual in that it's a floral fragrance that doesn't smell too much of flowers, let alone the titular one. There is a hint of peppery freesia, but it comes across more as clean linen than a flower. Likewise, there is a lot of waxy, yellow champaca blossom here, but only really perceptible as a burst of something lemony and creamy, like magnolia with an undertow of dusky honey. The flowers simply melt into the basmati rice accord to form a subtly peppery creaminess that relieves the sharp, tannic twang of the green tea and citruses. There is something ineffably charming about Champaca – it is rather hard to pin down, but its pearlized, milky freshness gives it all the delicacy of the inside of a conch shell. As sensual as clean skin, we highly recommend Champaca as a soft, slightly milky floral oriental that will enchant in even the hottest of weather."," Neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Frangipani Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Frangipani is testament to Linda Pilkington's exquisite taste, because instead of the cream-sodden tropicalia you might be expecting based on the name, Frangipani filters the brightly gaudy flower through a very European sensibility. In other words, no sun umbrellas or leis here. The scent itself opens with a bright squeeze of lime, before quickly sliding into a very true-to-life linden blossom, whose aroma of honey, creamed rice, and green powder forms a logical bridge to the central character of the show - the frangipani. The frangipani note here is so wonderful that it's been allowed to shine unfettered by too many other notes. The flower itself has a gently milky, nutty tiarÃ©-like scent that later tips over into the full-fat, salted butter of tuberose. But in its first blush, the frangipani displays a rosy peach facet that moistens the heart and gives it a gentle fruitiness. When the frangipani melts into the magnolia, plum, and orchid notes, it forms a blurred, chocolatey floralcy that feels as soft and inviting as the fuzz on a baby's cheek. A resinous, woody base keep the creaminess of the florals in check, ensuring that while Frangipani retains its balmy and exotic character, it never crosses the line into loudness. A beautiful scent for those who want to dip a tentative toe into tropical waters."," Linden blossom, magnolia, lime, frangipani, rose, tuberose, water lily, plum, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isfarkand Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand is a mysterious thing. Its structure is simple and relatively linear – peppery citruses over grassy vetiver and radiant woods – but it transmits such a laid-back, uncluttered appeal that you'll find yourself wondering if there's more to it than meets the eye. Ormonde Jayne's signature opening notes of pink pepper and citrus burn even brighter than normal here, giving the scent the exciting zestiness of a freshly-peeled lime. The peppery spice hugs the toasty cedar and vetiver tightly, the result being a close-knit mÃ©lange of clean woods, citrus, grass, and spice that is so pleasurable to wear that it doesn't really make sense to try and pick it apart.Isfarkand is as easy to wear as a favorite shirt, so don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for it, again and again, even over fragrances that you think you like better. It sounds simple - and it is - but somehow a certain Ormonde Jayne magic ties it all together, making it one of the classiest and most versatile everyday options for the modern man. As a subtle, my-skin-but-better woody vetiver for all seasons, Isfarkand is hard to beat."," Lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ormonde Man Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ormonde Jayne Man takes the bracing coniferous freshness of Ormonde Jayne Woman, and spins it in a slightly different direction, peppering the topnotes with a sparkling lemon and juniper pairing, and giving the basic structure a drier, cleaner feel, with plenty of cedar and agarwood in the drydown for muscle. Juniper, coriander, and a clever use of cardamom up front give the opening a turbo-blast of luridly green, almost fruity spice that propels the scent forwards, as if tied to a jetpack. Although different in feel and texture to Ormonde Jayne Woman, Ormonde Man retains all of its sister scent's mysterious, witchy atmosphere. Imagine losing your way in a thick pine forest in winter; it is dark and cold, but oddly, you feel at complete peace. All around you, the trees exhale their sweet essence of conifer and pine sap, and you breathe it in gladly, knowing that it is both cleansing and nourishing. The oud wood is dry and medicinal, but merged with the sandalwood, cedar, spice, and musk, it becomes less spice route and more traditional Chinese health potion. The drydown is a sheer wash of pinewood and pepper, a watercolor print of the powerful first half that nonetheless works as the perfect fragrance for a gentleman who favors class over volume."," Juniper berry, bergamot, pink pepper, cardamom, coriander, agarwood, black hemlock, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ormonde Woman Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ormonde Jayne Woman is one of those fragrances that are almost impossible to describe using the listed notes, because it only makes sense when explained as an atmosphere or a feeling. For example, we might be able to tell you that this scent contains cardamom, coriander, and the witchy-sounding black hemlock, but we're at a loss as to explain how or why the sum of this simple list of materials is a whole forest from The Brothers Grimm, complete with Hansel and Gretel, and Baba Yaga waiting in her smoky gingerbread house. And yet, it truly is.First, a forest's worth of pungent green herbs and grasses is unfurled beneath your feet, the dark shadows of poison ivy and European oaks swallowing up all the natural daylight at the edges. This velveteen, viridian carpet is dotted with moist, sweet little violets and jasmine petals, their frilly innocence incongruous against the sinister background of forest woods. Ormonde Jayne Woman is a deeply coniferous scent with a fair amount of bitterness, but what really tugs at the heartstrings is its errant thread of sweetness - that smoky, spicy amber note that weaves through the perfume like a siren call to tempt children and adults alike. One of the rare perfumes that truly deserves its reputation as“mysterious”, we defy you to wear this and not be shaken and stirred."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santo Incienso Extrait de Parfum,The Different Company," Originally released as Le15,  a one-time limited offering to celebrate The Different Company's 15-year anniversary of distinguished creations,  Santo Incensio – Sillage SacrÃ© is exactly the same formulation released under a new name for a new life. Described as“A sacred perfume that draws its secret from shamanic stances,  like a prayer to the sky, ” it showcases the supreme holy wood rarely used in perfumery,  palo santo.The opening spark is a bright flame,  both tart and smoky,  invoking the beginning of ritual. Fizzy orbs of bergamot and petitgrain crackle with delicate shavings of nutmeg,  fragrant and spicy. At the same time,  a vetiver-infused plume of smoke rises,  and palo santo makes its entrance. This is the sacred wood elevated to high chic,  a far cry from rustic bundles of wood - more like a glowing,  elegant veil with meditative grounding. Here,  the enchanting,  contradictory facets of palo santo are deftly highlighted – the citric effervescence,  piney cool,  and minty lightness. A supporting note of balsamic Atlas cedar adds to the creamy-yet-shimmering wood. A wood that releases its healing,  cleansing scent when burned,  it is unlike any other,  with pale smoke tendrils rising in subtle shades of incense and myrrh. As this soothing scent develops,  you can really feel the mastery of Alexandra Monet,  who's devised a way to approximate the feel of a holy incense that burns to clean white ash - leaving just a wisp of sacred smoke on the skin. Mystical,  yet contemporary and wholly fresh."," Bergamot, petitgrain, nutmeg, palo santo, Atlas cedar, Hedione, incense, myrrh, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25342.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dragonfly Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," Drifting through swaying reeds and billowing stalks of papyrus, a breeze gives chase to a sweet morning mist. A perfect mirror, revealed upon still green water, is shattered by a sudden shower, casting the gentle romance of lotus and iris into a frenzied, passionate rhythm. High above, tendrils of sunlight nudge away the grey clouds, their warmth drawing dense aromas from the dewy surfaces below. Beneath the dwindling ripples, restless nymphs stir and begin to emerge. Under the soft moonlight, the newly-hatched dragonflies spread fragile, virgin wings, poised to explore the world between pool and sky.Like a glade captured in delicate strokes upon an impressionist canvas, the rich, green floral medley of Zoologist Dragonfly transports you through a maze of moody tones and melancholy weather. This olfactory journey echoes the cycle of a cobalt pond, from the crackling light of dawn to the thick blanket of nightfall, under the gaze of the flitting dragonfly."," Aldehydes, Heliotrope, Lemon, Peony, Rainwater, Cherry Blossom, Clover, Iris, Lotus, Rice, Amber, Moss, Musk, Papyrus, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
United Arab Emirates Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," United Arab Emirates Spirit Of The Union, or UAE Aoud for short, is Roja Dove's love letter to the people of the Middle East who joyfully douse themselves in the richest and most luxurious of fragrances. For a sensualist such as Roja Dove, these are his spirit animals – men unafraid to wear the richest and creamiest of rose fragrances, and women who proudly wore the most animalic of ouds. UAE Aoud pays tribute to this taste for exuberance and luxury by loading up on the most sumptuous raw materials in the world – the costliest Taifi rose ottos, the smokiest, most refined Laotian oud, and the finest floral absolutes and concretes available this side of Grasse. Supported by a creamy mÃ©lange of white and yellow flowers such as jasmine, gardenia, and ylang, a bright, pure Taifi rose sings out, clearly the top-billing soprano. The leathery, animalic oud note is sharpened by an undercurrent of civet, but buried deep enough in a cloud of benzoin and spices to soften its impact. The roses, white flowers, and creamy civet come together over a dense, smoky layer of resins, woods, and oud, creating a shimmering, sensual halo of a scent."," Artemisia, bergamot, black currant, cloves, geranium, jasmine, rose, taif rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, benzoin, labdanum, civet, guaiac wood, incense, musk, oakmoss, patchouli, pink pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74819.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Douceur de Siam Eau de Parfum,Dusita," A perfume of strange, nocturnal beauty, La Douceur de Siam is like walking into a Thai spice garden overhung with night-blooming flowers. Creamy, dreamy, what could have been another pretty, classically composed white floral is sparked by vivid green notes and given a voluptuous exoticism with ylang-ylang, frangipani and champaca. La Douceur de Siam opens with a hothouse smell of stemmy greenery and a thorny rose so sharp you'd swear it had fangs. But soon, warm sandalwood arrives along with a soothing hint of vanilla to blanket the composition, and the rose becomes lush and welcoming. But the heart of La Douceur de Siam is the heady champaca flower – a cousin to gardenia with a suggestion of lime blossom and gentle spice. Douceur's champaca is hypnotically beautiful, languorous, suspended between peachy frangipani and dense, ripe ylang-ylang. As the notes develop and intertwine, the white flowers, rose and champaca harmonize on a bed of velvety clove and dry amber. The silken thread tying together spicy, fresh and silky notes in perfect harmony shows once again creator Pissara Umavijani ”˜s ability to introduce unexpected elements into classically composed genres. Hypnotically lovely, La Douceur de Siam is like half-waking from an enchanting dream."," May rose, Frangipani, Champaca flower, Clove, Ylang ylang, Violet leaf, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Sillage Blanc Eau de Parfum,Dusita," Inspired by Piguet's Bandit, Sillage Blanc is a modern chypre with a retro soul. This is Bandit with better manners and an independent streak of its own. With its bright herbal opening, Sillage Blanc is a chypre-leather riff, fresh, alternately crisp and mossy. Bandit's sharp greenness and fierce leather are there, but the rough edges have been smoothed out. Where Bandit is an emerald-eyed dominatrix cracking a horsewhip, Sillage Blanc is an urban garconne sporting a Kelly leather bag.Sillage Blanc opens with smack of bright green galbanum sharp as a nip-waisted suit. But soapy-sweet neroli soon tones down the galbanum bite, and orange blossom adds a touch of creamy florals. Sillage Blanc is not, however, simply Bandit's more genteel sibling. Little Sis has a naughty side of her own. A green, moist tobacco note adds an earthy, illicit quality. The bitter herbal notes are distinctive, amped up with artemisia and a vegetal ambrette before settling down on a mossy, woodsy bed. Completely unisex, Sillage Blanc is like a well-made Campari cocktail held by a gloved hand –bitter, leathery perfection."," Orange blossom, Neroli, Tobacco, Artemisia, Galbanum, Leather, Ambrette seed, Patchouli, Oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vespero Parfum Extrait,Jeroboam," A resolutely masculine extract dedicated to dandyish urban night owls, Vespero is the scent of a never-ending evening of pleasures both sophisticated and decidedly wicked. Your night begins with a swoon of rich, vibrant fruits, lent a darker, sexier edge with a refined heart of cedarwood and geranium. As richer, long-lasting notes of leather and patchouli emerge, the fragrance has gone from sunny to sensual, with smoky and earthy facets asserting themselves alongside the exquisitely musky base that makes the unified signature of all Jeroboam scents. Dark enough to seduce, bright enough to charm, and versatile enough for adventures big and small, Vespero is the perfect accessory for an imperfect gentleman."," Bergamot, apple, pink grapefruit, cedarwood, geranium, leather, jasmine, patchouli, ambery woods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Complet Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Tantalizingly tropical yet softly sensual, Santal Complet is a gorgeous new sandalwood scent that proves that Fragrance du Bois can do far more than just oud scents. In fact, by emphasizing the smooth, creamy, indulgent side of sandalwood with coconut, musk and vanilla, Santal Complet is a world away from the house's previous offerings, one that has us dreaming of white sand beaches and undisturbed crystal clear turquoise waters at the edge of the world.Santal Complet opens with the aforementioned coconut note, one of the best we've ever smelled: the perfect balance between refreshing and creamy, with a zingy patina of fresh lemon and black pepper. As the beautiful, multifaceted sandalwood warms up, we find it's the perfect companion for the coconut- gently sweet, creamy, and a blend of warm and cool tonalities that feel exactly like the afternoon sun hitting your still-wet-from-the-ocean-skin, with supporting notes of amber and vanilla supplementing without overwhelming. Plenty of scents promise vacation ambiance, but if you're seeking a getaway of unparalleled luxury, Santal Complet is uniquely qualified to soothe your wanderlust.Note: Santal Complet ""Parfum"" is an ""Eau de Parfum"" concentration, same original concentration as before. Parfum is only meant to be viewed a design reference on the label."," Lemon, coconut, violet, black pepper, musk, sandalwood, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hacivat Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Move over, because there's a new masculine in town, and guys, you're going to love this one. With tart, sparkling citrus draped over a backbone crisp with forest woods, oakmoss, and white jasmine, Hacivat recalls the oakmoss-laden glory of woody chypres like Pour Monsieur that once populated men's perfumery. Despite the solidly classical lines of the scent, Hacivat feels entirely modern, with a juicy pineapple note aerating the damp mosses and woods, and a touch of blackcurrant leaf keeping the tone fresh and outdoorsy. Don't be afraid of that pineapple note. Rich and natural-smelling rather than sporty or cheap, the pineapple note is so well done here that it redeems the reputation of the much-maligned fruit. Hacivat wears on the skin as lightly as a white linen shirt in summer. It is discreet, professional, and sparklingly clean, but possessed of just enough bitter moss and woods for gravitas. A rare, classically-built woody chypre with a contemporary edge, Hacivat just smells really wonderful and will make other people think you smell great too. Bookmark this scent if you love a modern classic."," Bergamot, pineapple, grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli, cedar, woody notes, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Karagoz Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Meaning“black eye”, this fragrance is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays, Karagoz, who plays the traditional, hearty peasant to Hacivat's educated statesman character. Despite Hacivat's constant efforts to civilize Karagoz, he remains joyfully honest, straightforward, and witty. Karagoz, the fragrance, is as pleasantly down-to-earth as the character it emulates. Although it features the same pineapple as in Hacivat, Karagoz's treatment of it couldn't be more different. Where Hacivat is dark, crisp, and elegant, Karagoz is hearty and rustic, with a rich array of harvest fruits, herbs, and sunburned grass notes framing the juicy tartness of the pineapple. It is at once fresh and outdoorsy, but also waxily sweet with hay and amber. Despite the rude cornucopia of harvest notes, though, Karagoz turns out to be very modern in feel, thanks to the dry, quasi-industrial oud note in the base that drapes the scent in a rich, metallic shimmer. Like the shadow play character, Karagoz has a booming, fleshed-out presence that's very difficult to ignore. Wear it on a night out and see how attention it garners."," Pineapple, grapes, herbal notes, neroli, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, oud, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77419.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zenne Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Zenne is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays – a woman whose voluptuous beauty is capable of bringing men to their knees. And Zenne the fragrance is every bit as self-confident, flirtatious, and pretty as the character it emulates. Think of the softest, rosiest blackcurrant musk you can imagine, glazed with milky musk and turned into a cloud of pink marshmallows, and that is Zenne.It begins in the palace garden, with a volley of pink grapefruit, rhubarb, and blackcurrant leaf, tart with morning dew. It is innocent, yet juicy and seductive. Slowly, piquant blackcurrants begin to pop against a cloudy backdrop of milky sandalwood, musk, and gardenia, staining the cream with purple juice. In the midst of all this, a rich Turkish rose ripens, slicking the tart, starchy berries and rhubarb with rose syrup, and adding body and thickness to the scent. A nugget of salty, chewy ambergris in the base extends the golden glow of the scent, giving it the sexy insolence for which the character of Zenne is known. Zenne is both innocent and come-hither – whipped up into a gentle pink froth of tart berries, creamy musks, and rich red roses, it presents an appeal that's hard to resist."," Grapefruit, blackcurrant (cassis), rhubarb, Turkish rose, gardenia, sandalwood, vanilla, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hundred Silent Ways Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Inspired by a line in a poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi poet,“I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways"", Hundred Silent Ways communicates love wordlessly through a series of little flourishes of fruit and flowers as tender as the skin of a loved one. There is an undeniably girlish flirtatiousness about Hundred Silent Ways, but it is also very elegant.The opening is ambrosial and frankly sensual, a Rococo burst of sweet, syrupy peaches, mandarin orange, and tuberose petals so juicy sweet that you will want to gulp it down greedily, heedless of the red juice staining your mouth. Bathed in a cloud of marshmallow-soft musk, the fruit and flowers slowly become more abstract and hazier in feel, but thanks to a touch of cool, powdery iris, it never loses its sparkle. By the time you get to the nutty, savory woodiness of the sandalwood in the base, soaking up all the rich, buttery excesses of gardenia, fruit, and cream, you will have been completely won over by the inviting deliciousness of Hundred Silent Ways. It is the rare fruity floral that seduces you without so much as a word."," Mandarin, tuberose, peach, white jasmine, gardenia, orris, vanilla, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fan Your Flames Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Inspired by the Sufi poet Rumi's exhortation to; ""Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames”, Fan Your Fames is a fiery, semi-gourmand fragrance that is all about the kind of passion that spills over into obsession. Featuring a haze of white shisha smoke over a mÃ©lange of woody coconut husks, booze, and a mossy, balsamic base, Fan Your Flames is a stunning take on tobacco that extends the material in several different directions at once. First, the dried fruit and molasses sweetness of tobacco leaf is drawn out in an exotic direction by way of coconut husk and rum, with a sort of fermented fruit undertone suggestive of Japanese brandy - the kind that costs $500 a bottle. Directly underneath this, coumarin coaxes the hay facets out of the tobacco leaf, introducing a uniquely dry, sunburned grass tonality that tempers the sweetness of the booze. In the base, cooling, greenish hints of fir, cedar, mint, and oakmoss emerge, accentuating the bitter woodiness inherent in dried tobacco leaves. Now imagine all this wrapped up in a haze of tarry smoke, like a leather armchair left to smolder in the ashes of a house fire. Fan Your Flames is intoxicating, obsessive, strange, and almost bewilderingly dense – wear it many times before the smoke starts to lift and you begin to understand its true beauty."," Coconut, rum, tobacco, tonka, oakmoss, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Afrika-Olifant Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Poised halfway between a masculine chypre and a musky oriental, Africa Olifant exerts a steady fascination over its wearer. But fear not - despite the extraordinary array of animalic notes packed into this scent, Africa Olifant pulls off the remarkable feat of being both richly dirty and a breeze to wear. If you love the mossy funk of old-school masculines like Antaeus, then this will be right down your alley.  The structure of the fragrance is quite clever. Instead of a top-down flow of notes, imagine a glowing core emanating concentric circles of rich aromas that strike the nose all at once – rubber, bone-dry leather, fiery balsam, melting tar, bitter moss, musk. There's also a lot of myrrh, first bathing everything in a haze of smoke and then drying down to a lingering impression of licorice, stone and earth. Everything feels so elemental, and yet, at its core, Africa Olifant is a super-smooth leather with a surprisingly balmy freshness to it. Citrus and herbs provide lift, and a sweet-salty ambergris spotlights everything with its golden glow. The end result is a fragrance that feels solidly classical, but also animalic in a way that not many modern masculines are these days."," Ambergris, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, castoreum, civet, leather, oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Calabria Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Ambra Calabria is an unusually fresh, leafy-green amber that departs from the standard model of vanilla and resin so thick you could stand a spoon up in ”˜em. The sour bite of Calabrian bergamot and the smoky greenness of the galbanum cut a swath through the amber, blowing it up with salt and air. This is what makes Ambra Calabria such a fantastic wear in hot summer weather.But Ambra Calabria really gives you the best of both worlds. It has all the spiky freshness of a traditional eau de cologne but also all the robustness of a full-blown oriental. So while the opening act is full of tart green and lemony notes that will snap your head to attention, the second act is built for comfort, not speed, with creamy jasmine blossoms tucked behind the ear of a musky, salted caramel base that seems to go on forever. Sweet and inviting on the bottom, tart and energizing on top, Ambra Calabria is the olfactory equivalent of Key Lime pie with a sprinkle of anise and salt on top. Summer in a bottle, dare we say."," Bergamot, galbanum, green leaves, jasmine, coriander, sweet amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sultan Vetiver Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Sultan Vetiver recalls the former glory of Guerlain Vetiver before it was gutted by reforms - earthy, rich, and woody, and with a bitter anisic bite that will make you think of the blackest of licorice. It is a particularly toothsome, rugged example of vetiver, and one that true vetiver enthusiasts should make a point of seeking out. Despite the name, there is nothing particularly oriental about Sultan Vetiver, although there is a richly embroidered nutmeat texture in the drydown suggestive of creamy resin. With impressive focus, the scent hones in on the noble green root, showcasing three separate types of vetiver oil that in turn display a rich variety of facets ranging from salt marsh, hazelnut, freshly-mown grass, rose, black pepper, and citrus fruit. In the base, tonka and amber resin melt away all the pungency of the root, bathing everything in a sweet olive-green bath of creamy goodness. Sultan Vetiver is an authentic vetiver fragrance that just smells amazing – and one that we predict will thrill purists and the vetiver-shy alike."," Java vetiver , anise, pink pepper, bergamot, bourbon vetiver, Haitian vetiver , neroli, tonka bean, amber, leather, Brazilian vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suede et Safran Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," SuÃ¨de et Safran uses fiery Iranian saffron and Indian ambrette seed to build one of the most pleasurably buttery suede perfumes in existence. It smells like a soft, dun-colored suede jacket that's been rubbed down with red-gold spice and musk grains until the delicate fibers begin to break down and dissolve into thin air.The juxtaposition between smoke and spice is played just right here, with the scent exerting a subtle undertow of sweetness that's downright addictive. Ambrette seed provides a boozy, unripe fruit note pitched halfway between pear and apple, and the vein of throaty spice lends a dark gingerbread sparkle. Quiet enough for day wear and yet assertive enough to give you billowing sillage on a big night out, SuÃ¨de et Safran is the perfect fragrance for people who love creamy, haute-luxe leathers like Tuscan Leather and Black Saffron, but who want to branch out into a warmer, drier direction."," Ambrette seed, saffron, suede, ginger, musk, caraway",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pachuli Kozha Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," Kozha means“skin” in Turkish, so if you're thinking that Patchouli Kozha mixes sensual, skin-like notes with the earthiness of patchouli, then you'd be right. But Patchouli Kozha is so much more than that. In fact, before we get down to the loam, we must first pass through a meadow, the scent opening unexpectedly on a naturalistic accord of grass and flowers, wet and torn after a violent storm. The opening crackles with ozone and electricity, hyacinth striding to the fore, a green, almost bitter artemisia at its side. Soon after, one becomes aware of a potent, sensuous ylang ylang snaking its way out of the grass, ripe with banana flesh and leathery indole. But the humid, near tropical smell of the ylang is held in check by the bright, peppery patchouli, and together these notes create a light, raw leather redolent with mint leaf and anise. The patchouli-ylang pairing is not particularly earthy or sweet, but cool and herbaceous - effortlessly sexy in a natural, tousled-hair kind of way. In the base, a sweeter tone creeps in, honey and resin thickening the patchouli, and giving it a warm, rounded feel. Towards the far drydown, a nubbin of frankincense weaves in and out of the honeyed patchouli and florals, drying everything out in a silvery haze of smoke and ether."," Hyacinth, ylang ylang, artemisia, chamomile, patchouli, black pepper, leather, honey, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tuberoza Extrait de Parfum,Nishane," If Tuberoza had a color, it would be a mixture of yellows and golds. Know why we like this one? Because unlike most tuberose fragrances that try to restrain the natural fleshiness of tuberose, Tuberoza sets it free to be its gorgeous, sunny self. Framed by sweet orangey notes, ylang, and honeyed orange blossom, the tuberose smells magnificent here: a flashy explosion of creamy, tropical sweetness, with an undercurrent of fuel, banana custard, and rubber. This is tuberose with all the lights turned on. No effort has been made to dim its naturally bright, loud character. Instead, tropical ylang and gardenia coax it out further into the sun, encouraging an expansion of its creamy, sweet excesses. Amber and marigold, as bright as a newly-minted gold coin, glitters underneath, and in the base, the scent gets a double helping of cream with the addition of a full-fat sandalwood and pearly white musk. Put this on and gasp with pleasure as Tuberoza billows softly across your skin like a giant, golden nuclear mushroom cloud. Its bolshy, take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, and the end result totally worth the ride."," Ylang ylang, orange blossom, artemisia, tuberose, jasmine, marigold, amberwood, vetiver, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77416.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
A City On Fire Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"“When I saw you, all I saw was a swirl of smoke in the streetlight. Elusive. Sinister.  Spectacular.”-MachusA brilliantly dark graphic novel, A City On Fire, is the story of two match-makers. Rupert literally fabricates matches in a factory on the waterfront while Frances writes a dating column for the city's newspaper. Both are recluses who haunt the night's shadows observing clandestine activities from afar but never partaking. That changes one fortuitous evening when they are both witness to the same high-profile murder and are forced to come together as an unlikely vigilante pair in order to save their own names.This scent is literally on fire - dark with firewood and spice, evoking both urban landscapes and the great outdoors, with smoke plumes rising into the air. The refined smoke accord makes this an austere and luxurious scent."," Cade oil, spikenard, cardamom, clearwood, dark berries, labdanum, burnt match",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Slow Explosions Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"“I was lost,  aimless,  and depressed. Now I'm only two of those things.”-Gwen K. VroomenIn 1980,  Gwen K. Vroomen quit a monotonous job,  went to the corner bar,  and – on the bartender's urging – threw a dart at a world map tacked on the wall. She had never heard of Goa but knew immediately she needed to go. Three months later she was celebrating Hindu New Year at a tea garden high in the hills of Kerala,  fireworks exploding below. She wrote of that night:“I was resuscitated by color,  redeemed by the vibrant unknown.” Her self-proclaimed“Journey out of darkness, ” dotted with unforgettable stories of night markets,  river floats,  and harrowing moped rides,  inspired a generation of young Americans eager to buck the drudgery of ordinary life. With pops of rose and hits of saffron,  this scent explodes on the skin and awakens the senses. Every inhale will open you up to the idea of escape,  push you to take risks,  and embolden you to get truly lost. Magical."," Saffron, rose absolute, leather, apple, benzoin, cashmeran, Arpora night market",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Saint Julep Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"“Tomorrow I will fight but tonight I recline into a sweet dream of muddled mint and ice.”– Milton NeversOn the outskirts of Clarksdale, Mississippi, at the end of a secluded dirt road sat a small ramshackle church. It was not a place of worship but rather where many went to seek refuge during impoverished times. Legend has it the structure was transported to the wild mint field by hand, hoisted on the shoulders of two dozen men. The outside remained simple and nondescript but the interior was aglow with pilfered neon signs, Christmas lights, and a jukebox donated by the sheriff's son. It was a distinctly secular place where locals who knew where to find it could share moonshine, socialize, and dance their troubles away. They called their ramshackle juke joint Saint Julep and the oral histories compiled within paint a picture of that magical place where“the smiles was always free and salvation had the distinct smell of sweet mint.”This scent is like a mint julep in the heat of the south, complete with invigorating mint leaves and a light bourbon body, with an added ""ice"" accord, sugar and a hint of magnolia. All of this adds up to arguably the perfect hot-weather scent."," Sweet mint, tangerine, southern magnolia, bourbon, grisalva, sugarcube, crushed ice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Garage Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Do not make the mistake of judging this book by its cover. Garage brings to mind images grease, oil and rubber, but this is one evocative fragrance that will surprise you. Its uniqueness lies in calling to mind some of the places we loved most as children: Your father's workbench or your grandpa's old toolshed. Places steeped in memories and lost in time. It's like curling up in that old leather recliner with your dad after he'd worked on the car. Not harsh and never sharp, Garage is all the good things about childhood and all the comfort scents you rarely indulge in as an adult."," Laurel aldehyde, traces of kerosene, leather notes, plastic floral notes, vetiver acetate, Chinese cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77205.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soda Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Fizzy! Uplifting! We can't help but put exclamation marks because Soda is genuinely happy, enough to make cave-dwelling goth boy or girl crawl out and frolic in the sunshine. Who cares if only a couple of ingredients are recognizable as being from this planet?  Soda is a bubbly, effervescent version of limeade with enough base (Galaxolide-it's a light musk, who knew?) to give it a perfect dose of grown-up depth. There's even a version of lily of the valley in here, which lends Soda a tiny bit of creamy softness. Tell us you don't smile (and make everyone else grin) when you wear this. We dare you."," Aldehydes, lime, citral, pimenal, lilial, iso-eugenol, galaxolide, acetal Rum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77206.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tar Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," A speedway on a scorching afternoon. Hot asphalt on a Roman street filled with car exhaust and the scent of fine leather-soled shoes softening on the pavement. Tar is for the brave, for those who find the smell of a crowded, polluted city and all its modern trappings a thing of glory. The earth notes and resinous opoponax lurk quietly, giving Tar a quirk that picks your face off the pavement just for a second. Virile and weirdly familiar, it's not for the faint of heart. This is man versus the modern world, and the modern world wins."," Town gas, vapours of bitumen, bergamot, earth notes, opoponax, styrax, grilled cigarettes, pyrogenic notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Palisander Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," An enigma wrapped in wood and spice from all corners of the globe, Palisander is derived from the red wood of the palisander tree of Brazil (also called Brazilian rosewood) and the mighty red cedar from Virginia. The feel of Palisander is a soft, old, polished wood with the patina of age-no sharp notes of fresh wood are present.  Saffron, the most precious and costliest spice in the world, wafts in the background, while myrrh sweetens the whole concoction. This is the imagined scent of a wood-filled room still holding the traces of fragrant myrrh incense from a century ago. Utterly intoxicating and deep."," Brazilian palisander wood, Virginian red cedar, Japanese red chili peppers, saffron from Iran, myrrh from south Yemen",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sequoia Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Comme des Garcons wasn't going for the 'mood' of an ancient forest; they were going for the exact scent of the most massive trees ever to inhabit the earth. Evocative and the most unusual of the Red series, Sequoia is a majestic and powerful king (or queen)-of-the-wood fragrance; we smell a touch of moss, tempered by the mystical kara-karounde, a jasmine-like ingredient used in the Congo for fertility spells (hey, don't blame us if things get out of hand). You don't need to sneak into Yosemite and smell the fresh, exposed redwood as you carve your name in a Giant Sequoia - that'll just get you arrested. All you need is a whiff of CdG's Sequoia - all the smell and none of the jail time."," California redwood, red rum, opopanax, kara-karounde from Guinea, Chinese agarwood, mahogany",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Cologne Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Eau de Cologne was created as a light,  fresh and dynamic fragrance,  a“feel-good energy giving” scent. When the Eau de Cologne was released in 1994,  it took its underlying amber note from the original ""Eau de Parfum, "" but gave it a light,  airy twist. The spice-rich opening is buoyant,  with added brightness from fresh citrus. But you can really feel it in the green and vibrant heart of the scent,  where liquid-light magnolia floats along with peppery freesia,  and hints of sheer roses. It's a Comme des Garcons kind of move - take an androgynous watery-floral cologne that embodies the spirit of the 90's and infuse it with a shot of French old-school chic. The result is idiosyncratic,  edgy,  and yet - elegant.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Calamus Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Calamus is the crown jewel of all green scents. It's the fragrance of living plants, of freshly crushed stems and crumpled leaves.

There are no sharp pine or tree notes here; Calamus is gentle and almost milky, a jumble of young leaves still sweet in their unfurled glory. For those who seek greener pastures, look no more.

This Is Not A Blue Bottle Eau de Parfum,Histoires de Parfums," Histoires de Parfums has enchanted us for years with evocative scent stories meticulously set in carerfully chosen times and places. But for This Is Not A Blue Bottle, Gerald Ghislain felt compelled to move in the opposite direction and deliver a scent divorced from the usual trappings, a dadaist canvas both teeming with energy but also presented as a blank slate, where the interaction between the scent and the nose that experiences it is a full collaboration, free of preconceived conceptual bias. The resulting fragrance is intentionally hard to pin down, a vibrant yet layered unisex spicy floral with intense metallic aldehydes, sweet honey, and luminously warm ambered patchouli. The flacon itself is a object of beauty, the familiar yet striking angled Histoires de Parfums bottle redone in eye-popping matte blue, entirely opaque, inviting the wearer to invent his or her own story as soon as the perfume touches their skin- and not a moment before."," Aldehydes, orange zest, honey, geranium, musk, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Close Up Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," From the inner self to the outside world, from the smallest to the largest, the composition of Close Up revels in contrast and the oscillation between opposites.

Close Up opens with a cherry that is not candy sweet, but sour, liquor-soaked, and complex as a Griotte cherry. Blooming with a fine dusting of spices with anise, the cherry is paired with green coffee beans, bitter and lightly reminiscent of its roasted twin.

Empathy Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Empathy is the meeting of two minds, and in this eponymous perfume, there is a meeting of two elements that are just as simpatico with each other: a bright, boozy raspberry-pear accord and a smoky, ashy tobacco. Although it leans slightly feminine, anyone who appreciates Tuscan Leather should take note.The fruit element is playful and interesting: the raspberry is not the hyper-sugared variant seen in fruitchoulis, but rather a tart, fuzzy variant soaked in the Cognac-like richness of davana and pear juice. Rising up to meet and subsume it is a wave of darker, more serious elements – a Patrician accord of cigarillo ash, dry tobacco, and musk, all of which merge into a grey suede that touches briefly on Tuscan Leather but skitters away again into something creamier and hazier. The bright raspberry endures throughout, and actually kind of symbolizes the appeal of this scent: sparkling but sturdy and tenacious. A fruit scent with steel in its backbone."," Pear blossom, raspberry flowers, Indian davana, fruity tobacco, raspberry infusion, scorched wood, transparent mosses, benzoin, silver fir, Irian oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Altruist Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," This is the new Eau de Parfum version of Altruist, originally released in 2016 as a collaboration between J.F. Schwarzlose and the Berlin artist Paul deFlorian. The result of a series of intense conversations between perfumer VÃ©ronique Nyberg and deFlorian, every note in Altruist represents a color or brushstroke from one of deFlorian's paintings. It is an unusual concept for a perfume, but one that works so beautifully it's been shortlisted for the Independent Perfume category in the Art and Olfaction Awards 2017. Altruist opens with fresh, sparkling notes of bergamot, lemon, and ginger representing the swirls of light green and aquamarine colors on the painting, while the warmer slashes of red and orange on the canvas are translated via the explosive heat of cracked black pepper and nutmeg. The almost sterile“froideur” of the man's sightless gaze in the painting is portrayed through use of a special MANE captive molecule called Aqual, which gives the scent a cold, crystalline shimmer, like sunlight on a diamond. For the new EDP version, the perfumer and artist decided to add Ambrarome, a material that gives the perfume a dense, dry woodiness with an undertone of something moist and bitter, creating the delightful effect of paper dipped in Japanese calligraphy ink. DeFlorian himself calls Altruist a“scent for feminists, cyborgs and survivors”, and in our opinion, it is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a balance between the sappy freshness of citrus and the tinder-dry crackle of woods and spice."," bergamot, lemon, ginger, watery notes, rose, orange blossom, nutmeg, black pepper, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, ambrarome",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Leder 6 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Leder. Even the sound of the German word for leather sounds Ã¼ber naughty, doesn't it? But if you're worried that Leder 6 is a hardcore leather with the full-on kink factor of a Berlin night club, then rest easy – it's not. With its notes of hot milk, candy, and rubber, Leder 6 is more rakish than kinky. More importantly, it's gorgeous and all kinds of addictive.Leder 6 starts out with a creamy white leather accord that's as ergonomically smooth as the interior of a brand new Porsche. The suede upholstery, although streamlined and modern in feel, is enriched with accents of warm vanilla milk, white chocolate, candied apricots, and a strange but delicious biscuit-like tone. At first steamy and moist, the fragrance grows increasingly dry and powdery, with notes of rubber, resin, and gun smoke emerging in the drydown. In the final tally, we find Leder 6's heady mix of rubber and milk to be bold and exotic, but also as inviting as a deeply-powdered bosom. A fragrance that titillates rather than provokes, and in our opinion, all the better for it."," Osmanthus, saffron, leather, milk, vanilla, incense, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zeitgeist Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Think all modern marine fragrances rely too heavily on the melon sweetness of Calone? Try Zeitgeist. It's the rare marine fragrance that, although composed of a long list of laboratory molecules, pulls off the feat of smelling utterly natural.  If you love the collected smells caught in your sweater after a walk on a cold beach – ozone, salt, minerals, and the faint musk of warm skin – then this fragrance is for you. Structured around the salty glitter of ambergris and the damp, almost fruity greenness of seaweed, Zeitgeist works beautifully on both girls and boys who love the Great Outdoors. The scent gains lift through a complex arrangement of musks, infusing the structure with space and air, and making it a feather-light wear. Warmed through from the base with a golden nugget of spicy Peru balsam and dusty woods, there is an exquisite balance between the briny wetness of the ocean and the dryness of driftwood. Zeitgeist is a subtly sexy fragrance for summer that makes us hear the roar of the ocean even when we're stuck inside."," Amber Xtreme, Peru balsam, Calone, seaweed, Nebulone, Edelonide, Leatherwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rausch Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Rausch means rush in German, and boy, they weren't kidding - this is one powerful rush to the head that you won't forget in a hurry. One spritz of this stunning fragrance and you are ready for a night of Berlin-style debauchery that even Baudelaire would be proud of. Rausch starts us off in a haze of dry smoke from the club, dark and thrillingly bitter on the tongue, woody and strange. Then a roar of golden oud and amber suddenly swells up from beneath, engulfing your senses in a tidal wave of aged whiskey, red pepper, and rich, resiny balsam. There is plenty of earthy patchouli, a musky, dirty vanilla too, which in combination with the leathery oud gives the fragrance the feel of something depraved and illicit, something dug up from undisturbed soil. Deeply sexy in an almost bewildering way, the raunchy Rausch is a fragrance that broadcasts at ten paces and is therefore perfect for the clubs: wear this and find men, women, and children drawn to you as if you've rolled around in catnip."," Red pepper, sandalwood, cypriol, patchouli, vanilla bean, amber, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
IA-33 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Named for the original car license plate of pre-war Berlin, 1A-33 is J. F. Schwarzlose's first modern retooling of one of their heritage perfumes. If you're thinking there's a classic tone to this perfume, then you'd be right, especially with the scent's emphasis on the rich aroma of linden blossom trees in full bloom along the famous Unter den Linden Boulevard in Berlin. It draws the mind immediately to the bourgeois pleasures of sipping tea and reading the morning news in a cafÃ© in the dappled shade.  But this is not a perfume drowning under the weight of nostalgia - it is neither staid nor powdery. In fact, in its perfectly-judged balance between the creamy honey of magnolia, linden blossom, and jasmine and the sharpness of pink pepper and mandarin, 1A-33 reveals itself to be a thoroughly modern fragrance. It's this peppery little kick to the gait of this perfume that makes it such a joy to wear, especially on cool, sunny mornings. One spray of this and you're guaranteed to feel all the euphoria of spring in Berlin, flowers and leaves bursting into life above your head. A perfume with eyes set firmly forward to the future, not backwards to the past."," Mandarine, pink pepper, Spree river accord, jasmine sambac, lime-tree blossom, magnolia, cedarwood, iris powder",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kai Rose - Perfume Oil Roll-on Perfume Oil,Kai," Kai is a true phenomenon unlike any other, known for the lush yet clean scent of gardenia, effortlessly captivating. This newly developed scent is Kai's fresh take on the classic rose, and as one would expect, blooms gorgeously on skin.Kai Rose is no old-fashioned tea rose, nor is it brooding - instead, imagine the platonic ideal of a fresh, romantic rose, vibrant and deep pink. Now wrap it in Kai's signature luscious, exotic white flowers - what was at once familiar and lovely feels like a new encounter all over again. Precious rose absolute and all-natural essences embody the philosophy of kai: breath, life, flow. This soft, subtle fragrance can be worn on its own, or complemented by the original Kai for added effect. Kai Rose Perfume Oil is packaged in an easy to use, roll-on vial to be conveniently carried and stored for a quick and simple application."," Gardenia, white flowers, rose absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/10126.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blossom Love Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Fresh with the vibrant romance of springtime, Blossom Love is as resplendent as the blossoming cherry trees that give inspiration to this new addition to Amouage's Secret Garden collection. Bright, beautiful, and gently gourmand, it's the perfect scent to greet the changing weather, a paean to the joy and meaning inherent in the transition of the seasons. Opening with the luscious freshness of cherry blossoms suspended in a lightly boozy rose liqueur, Blossom Love gives an almost instantaneous feeling of giddiness, tempered with just enough restraint to never lose its youthful energy. A sweet floral heart, ylang touched with amaretto, is equally bubbly, making our mouths water and our hearts burst forth with seasonal enthusiasm. A rich yet understated drydown of tonka, sandalwood and vanilla likewise exudes a solar warmth, never crossing over into dessert territory but rather suspending us in a near-weightless bliss, a deeply romantic springtime fantasy that seems to hover above the ground. Cherry blossoms are all the more beautiful for how fleeting their bloom can be. With Blossom Love, that unabashed beauty can now be enjoyed any day of the year."," Cherry blossom nectar, rose liquor, ylang ylang, amaretto, vanilla, tonka bean, sandalwood, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41885.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Epidor Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Inspired by the enduring traditions of the autumn wheat harvest in France, Epidor is not simply a fragrance, but a portal to a simpler time. Originally introduced in 1912, Epidor evokes images of sun-kissed youth from farming villages, exhausted from a hard day's work, resting in the newly cropped fields and daydreaming about the night's celebrations, and hopefully, romances. Epidor's nostalgically lovely scent is built around the multifaceted richness of tonka bean, a material that can elicit tones of fresh hay, vanilla, and sweet florals all at once, but the fragrance opens first with a rich autumnal blend of sweet, musky violet and juicy plum, followed quickly by a lushly natural white floral heart of jasmine and orange blossom. By the time the tonka asserts itself, we're deeply enthralled, awash in the warmth of the setting sun and the bucolic splendor of the French countryside. Gentle, comforting and evocative, Epidor is a fragrance of simple, wondrous beauty."," Violet, plum, jasmine, orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sole di Positano Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," There is nothing like the thrill of a good citrus to refresh on a hot summer's day, and this is a superb rendition. Although done very much in the style of Neroli Portofino with its bitter, sun-drenched citrus notes, Sole di Positano offers a more Spring-like variation by adding wet, fresh green notes like lily of the valley and shiso leaf, and a graceful oakmoss drydown that smells like cool shade and oaked wine. But still, this is the Amalfi coast, and the citrus notes reign supreme. The bitter green and yellow fizz of bergamot, bitter orange, lemons, and shiso act like a cold shower on a hot day, drenching the wearer in icy freshness from head to toe. Pull your nose back from the skin, and it is the cool, soapy neroli and orange blossom that lingers most in the air, providing for a clever dual effect of bitter citrus up close and crisp white floral from afar. Arched over a sturdy, mossy base and“fixed” in place by the florals and herbs, this effect goes on forever. An elegant solution to the usually fleeting pleasure of the eau de cologne!"," Calabrian bergamot, bitter orange, mandarin, lemon, shiso leaf, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, jasmine, lily of the valley, neroli, moss Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Sole di Positano by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Absolue d'Osmanthe Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," If osmanthus is having a moment in modern perfumery, it's a well-deserved one: elegantly fruity, sensual and softly creamy, it's long past time that this beautiful floral stepped out of the supporting shadows and into the limelight. And it would be hard to think of a more impressive debutante than Absolue d'Osmanthe, an utterly stunning new floral scent fresh off of taking Esxence 2017 by storm and now ready to go worldwide. Fresh and fruity, but also richly mouthwatering and romantic, this is everything we always suspected a perfect osmanthus scent could be. Absolue d'Osmanthe wastes no time putting its gorgeous title ingredient front and center, opening bright and fruity with the apricot-like tones the flower is known for. As with all great soliflore scents, the supporting notes are meant less to twist the fragrance in any particular direction and more to coax out each facet of the featured player, and Absolue completely delivers: plum to add juicy depth to the fruity notes and rose and jasmine to accentuate the luscious softness. As it dries, subtly rich balsamic, woodsy and creamy notes (with just the right hint of animalic castoreum) emerge to resonate with the smooth, leather-toned sexiness hidden within osmanthus's soft lactonic depths. Is Absolue d'Osmanthe the perfect osmanthus scent? At the very least, we're confident when we say this impossibly gorgeous fragrance is going to be quite hard for future challengers to top."," Osmanthus, plum, baie rose, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, tolu balsam, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla, dry woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70208.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal du Pacifique Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," There's a reason why sandalwood is among the most important and widely used materials in fragrance, with a versatility that allows perfumers to explore everything from creamy richness to sophisticated coolness. Featuring an extraordinary sandalwood from the South Pacific, where the species was discovered, Santal du Pacifique demonstrates the full range of this majestic material, woodsy, naturalistic, but also velvety and smooth, all in the service of a fragrance that manages to perfectly balance elegance with simplicity.Every supplemental ingredient in Santal du Pacifique seems expertly chosen to enhance the titular material, from the earthy balance of the carrot and earthy floral opening, to the rich balsam and smooth musk of the later stages. Each reveals an extra facet of sandalwood, sometimes sexy and fashion-forward, often rich and comforting, always with a dignity that belies its luxury. For those who find that  subtle, natural sandalwood fragrances don't pack enough punch, but that edgy, complicated sandalwoods have wallpapered over their star ingredient's natural brilliance, we say that Santal du Pacifique is the most exquisite compromise you could ever dream of."," Carrot, orchid, violet, gurjum balsam, Pacific sandalwood, dry woods, cashmere woods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70209.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Blackberry,Comptoir Sud Pacifique," A heavenly exercise by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, exploring the possibilities for a fragrance both fresh and velvety-soft. Vanille Blackberry sings brightly from the start, opening playfully tart with a burst of fizzing lemon and bergamot. Then, the lovely cloud of floral fruit takes over, with rose and jasmine in attendance, but never too heady, just light and pretty. But in the billowing cloud, the stars of the show are blackberry and vanilla, forming a sweet, velvety-soft melange. The blackberry creates a perfect, lightly piquant contrast to the swoon-worthy classic Comptoir Sud Pacifique vanilla. Like a tea-time delicacy, this soft, floral-fruity vanilla just gets smoother in the drydown, light and delicate, enveloped in white musk and cashmere woods. Luscious, fluffy, yet glowing - a must for any vanilla lover."," Lemon, bergamot, rose, jasmine, blackberry, pink berries, musk, vanilla, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/23814.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Tonne de Roses Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," So called because it takes 3.5 tons of rose petals to make just one kilo of rose essence, Une Tonne de Roses has a natural delicacy that belies its hefty name. It opens with a fresh, soft pink rose glistening with the wet sparkle of fruit – green apple or an Asian pear, perhaps. There is also, briefly, a hint of something winey and truffled playing around the edges of the rose, but it never commits to darkness. This is an innocent little rosebud of a rose, just about to burst into being.We start out in Spring, with a dewy rose, but we end up in Fall, with a clean, earthy patchouli. Although more a watercolor than the gouache of Almairac's earlier masterpiece, Voleur de Roses, Une Tonne de Roses completes a similar journey, fading from the pale pink blush of the rose to the golden brown leaf mulch of patchouli. Finishing in a clean, crystalline musk, Une Tonne de Roses strikes us as a Japanese screen version of the ever-popular rose and patchouli combination – delicate, crisp, and achingly pretty."," Rose, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flavia Vanilla Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Inspired by the lyrical, shiny-eyed beauty of an Italian girl called Flavia that Michel Almairac once knew, Flavia Vanilla is a dark, minimally smoky floral vanilla with hints of a tropical, humid ylang ylang playing at its edges. The spiced banana flambÃ© of ylang of the opening notes is as attention-getting as a confident lady who dances her way through a crowded piazzo. But there is also a fresh, youthful breeze running through the perfume – a touch of green magnolia-like notes from the michelia flower that serve to keep the flamboyant sensuality of the custardy ylang firmly in check. Flavia Vanilla is a scent that reminds us that simplicity is the key to true beauty, and that sometimes all that's need is fresh vanilla, flowers, and a trace of smoke to fill the heart with pleasure."," Ylang ylang, michelia, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Totally White Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Totally White captures the ethereal, foggy dew of a spring morning in a Parisian city park. It smells like a field of wildflowers waking up en masse. The delicate, slightly honeyed scent of lilac and wisteria mingle with the intoxicatingly bitter, leathery scent of the hawthorn bushes, creating an effect so pollen-rich and watery-cool that you'd forgive early morning joggers for looking dazed and slightly drunk. This is a fragrance whose subtlety might make you forget you're wearing it but for the perceptible effect it has on people around you. The pale, soft-focus blurriness of the florals merges so completely with the pheromones of your own skin that people hugging you will pull you a little tighter, entranced by what they think is your natural smell. It is an intimate, soft scent, the foggy musk and pale spring flowers all working together to form a muted color palette against which your own personality sparkles like a diamond. Beautiful work."," Lilac, wisteria, hawthorn",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cedar Woodpecker Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," The amusingly-named Cedar Woodpecker is a spicy, citrusy cedar fragrance with impeccable taste and noble lineage. At once robust and refined, the rich Virginian cedarwood forms the glowing brown heart of the fragrance, displaying a stoutness of character you just know you can rely on. On top, a turbo-charged cedrat fizzes and snaps like a cable wire loose in a storm – this note is exciting and has movement, charging the sturdy cedar underneath with electricity. The contrast between the sourness of that green citrus and the warmth of the cedar is both exhilarating and comfortable. It just works. A dove-grey iris in the base is a fluffy pillow on which the cedar finally rests his grizzled, noble old head. The faint hint of powdery florals doesn't detract from the muscular, essentially woody, masculine character of the scent, but rather add a velvety softness that soothes and calms. The iris also introduces the faint echo of Guerlainade: lovers of the classic Habit Rouge might want to check out its more modern, stripped-down, and rugged younger brother. In an age when men are short-changed on good masculines, Cedar Woodpecker comes as a welcome surprise."," Cedar, citrus, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milky Musk Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In the late 1990's and under the direction of Tom Ford, Michel Almairac created one of the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century: Gucci Rush. A massive lactonic peach with a voice like a foghorn, it wore like the tightest, shiniest red vinyl dress ever created. Now twenty years later, Michel picks up the reins again to create a softer, muskier version that explores the same theme of milk and fruit, but this time with an indoors voice. Milky Musk first melts a leafy-green, coconutty fig down into a pool of warm, creamy sandalwood and wraps it all in a cloudy, milky musk that feels like cashmere. Soft and vaporous, it shifts around the body like a second skin as the wearer moves. Over time, the musk parts to reveal the bitterness of fruit skin, giving the creamy lactones an adult bite. Imagine a slimmed-down Rush, grown soft and husky with age, and you're in the right ballpark. It's adorable."," Sandalwood, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tomboy Neroli Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Tomboy Neroli is a paradox: sexy and clean. It smells like a freshly-laundered cotton t-shirt stripped off a hot, young body that has been wearing a classic eau de cologne all day. Male or female? Doesn't matter. When it's this good, it's for everyone.  The crisp greenness of neroli up top is as refreshing as drenching oneself in eau de cologne straight from the fridge on a hot day. As it melts into the waxy orange blossom notes underneath, the neroli loses its freshness and becomes subsumed by the honeyed warmth of the white floral. All of this draped over a smoky woody amber that gives you the chemical high of a good white musk. The equivalent of the perfect white t-shirt, this one's for sexy tomboys everywhere."," Neroli, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Woody Perfecto Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Woody Perfecto is a seemingly simple mix of coffee, vetiver, and leather, but there is something so nailed about this fragrance that it's hard to keep a grin off our face. Coffee is a difficult note to pull off; in Woody Perfecto, you get a perfectly dark, roasted bean with no off notes or milkiness to distract from the main event. Just damn fine coffee, as Agent Cooper would say.   With a smoky vetiver and a touch of black, worn leather, we have no difficulty grasping the vision of the scent's creators here when they talk about living in the shoes of a rock star. Wearing this, we are suddenly drinking black coffee, watching the roadies rigging the sound equipment, breathing in the smell of warm, trampled grass, cigarette smoke, and the warm bodies of excited fans pressing close. Dark and straightforwardly masculine, this is what you wear when anticipation is a shape in the air."," Coffee, vetiver, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Satori Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," For her house's signature scent,  Satori Osawa needed the perfect fusion of French and Japanese materials,  techniques,  and aesthetics,  and yet her inspiration came from a precious ingredient derived from somewhere else entirely- Middle Eastern agarwood,  or oud. And yet,  the choice is perfect,  as agarwood exemplifies the Japanese concept of ""five tastes, "" exhibiting spicy,  bitter,  sweet,  sour and salty facets all at once. A fragrance that fully encapsulates all five of these elements,  Satori features a carefully selected suite of notes meant to complement each,  with cinnamon and clove enhancing the spicy,  cacao the bitter,  vanilla the sweet,  and bitter orange,  oak moss and cypress for the sour and salty. Blended over a smooth,  woody bed of sandalwood and frankincense,  eastern and western elements converge with sublime balance,  creating a gentle,  warm and enveloping atmosphere. In this way,  Satori is ultimately a fragrance that is universal but delightfully specific,  where Japanese concepts become a global philosophy- elegant,  romantic and enchanting."," Bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Homme Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," The traditional arts of Japan are permeated with a dedication to simplicity- the idea that the more diligently and deliberately a flower is placed, or a brushstroke applied, the more significant it becomes. As a guiding principle for perfumery, it represents a departure from the operatic construction of European classics, and it is this principle that makes Iris Homme a deeply distinguished masculine of powerful subtlety. Iris Homme opens with bright, clarifying citrus, an authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast with an undercurrent of spicy cardamom that leads into the dry floral heart. The iris in question recalls MPG's classic Iris Bleu Gris in its clean, robust take on the note, but here the naturalism is slightly more incorporated, as an earthy violet and jasmine combination lingers softly but noticeably in the background. A warmly accessible base of ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple and long-lasting character, making this an ideal fragrance for situations formal and informal alike. Simplicity, after all, leaves ample room for interpretation."," Lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hana Hiraku Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," The Oriental category of perfumes has long been embellished by Western perfumers,  constructing olfactory fantasies as seen from the outside. With Hana Hiraku,  Satori Osawa deconstructs the Oriental,  departing from what she calls the westernized“glossy note” and,  as a Japanese perfumer,  creates a new category that she calls a“Dry Oriental, "" defined by a more matte quality. In Hana Hiraku (or“A Flower Blooms”),  earthy,  savory notes of miso and mitarashi,  or sweet soy sauce,  replace the animalic notes present in more Middle Eastern-style Oriental perfumes. The sensual,  intoxicating quality of Oriental perfumery transforms into coolly understated je-ne-sais-quoi,  like a romantic at arm's length.  Hana Hiraku blooms first with a sweet,  creamy musk melon,  freshly cut with a salted knife. The honeydew is soft but prominent,  and lifts up pale,  watery magnolia flowers in all their green and aquatic glory. Quite distinctive is the addition of Japanese miso,  which lends its uniquely briny,  earthy umami quality to ground the floating magnolia. This union is actually not unusual in Japanese cuisine,  where the large leaves of the magnolia tree are used as plates or for wrapping and baking miso or mochi rice cakes. This harmonious relationship reaches new heights with the sustained soft-focus cream of the melon,  and achieves a sublime sensuality for the senses. This is no dripping or heavy scent,  but rather it is perfume as seen through a frosted glass – diffuse,  tender,  and delicately blurred."," Melon, bergamot, galbanum, magnolia, iris, jasmine, tuberose, rose, ylang ylang, chamomile, miso, kogashi-shoyu, beeswax, sandalwood, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wasanbon Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori," Wasanbon is an intricate puzzle veiled in beguiling charm. Evoking Japanese tea-time, Wasanbon is a type of fine Japanese sugar hand-purified in multiple stages, used to make the highest class of delicate sugar candy. Perfumer Satori Osawa was tickled by its homonym in French,“Wa sent bon” meaning“Wa smells good” – Wa being the Japanese word for social harmony. Unlike the typical scent imagined from the concept of Wa, Wasanbon is mischievous, gliding into any situation with its sparkling confectionary charm, but slowly revealing the elegant, refined heart within. A tart, tangy lemon opens the fragrance, immediately uplifting, giddy on clouds. Not only is it sprinkled with crystalline sugar, but rounded out with juicy muscat grape, tart and sweet. These immediate fruits give way to a most delicate, pillowy mÃ©lange of lightly honeyed mimosa flower, lily-of-the-valley, and the body of the fragrance, an exquisite wasanbon sugar, finely purified and crushed, sieved into the finest powder. A dusting of almond and vanilla only add to the heavenly delight of the senses. As the candy dissolves away, Wasanbon remains light and airy, lifted with an exquisite iris and soft, velvety guaiacwood. What could be more charming?"," Lemon, muscat, mimosa, muguet, almond, sugar, honey, vanilla, iris, guaiacwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto Extrait de Parfum,UNUM," Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto - ""There are no hands / to caress my face."" This is the beginning of a 1948 poem by Father David Maria Turoldo, which the Italian photographer Mario Giacomelli took as the name for a photography series in the early 1960s. It's these photos that serve as the inspiration for UNUM's founder and artist Filippo Sorcinelli's new fragrance. The photos are striking: disarming images of young priests in states of joyous movement, dancing and playing. The fragrance is an olfactory rendering of the stunning imagery, capturing the humanity beneath the black cassocks.  The fragrance opens with a fizzy glow of crackling petitgrain and bergamot, which lifts up to reveal the heart: a breathtaking wall of scent, flawlessly blended cedar with spice, like cinnamon, and clary sage, ylang ylang, and resins. The drydown evokes what we imagine the seminary could have been, its stone walled building resonating with sandalwood, rituals cloaked in incense and benzoin, and the warm puff of tobacco. It transports you into Giacomelli's photographs of the clergymen smoking cigars - when the rector saw these images, it was the last straw, and Giacomelli was prevented from ever photographing at the seminary again."," Petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Phantom Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Through a glass, darkly. Black Phantom is a unisex woody gourmand that will please just about everyone. Its topnotes have a dangerous glitter to them, like a glass of rum rimmed in cane sugar set alight, sending sparks of roasted nuts, caramel, booze, and smoke out into the night air. Once the boozy fireflies have dimmed a little, a gentler accord begins to bloom – a wonderfully soft, nutty sandalwood that reminds us of caramelized pain de mie dipped into warm milk. But despite all the foodie notes, Black Phantom is not thick or heavy. Shot through with wisps of woodsmoke, resin, and roasted coffee, Black Phantom is clearly a gourmand aimed at more adult tastes. Imagine a cozy Parisian cafÃ© on a cold, rainy day. You are reading a book and sipping a milky coffee with a drop of rum on the side to warm your bones. Delicious aromas of pralines, fresh pastries, chocolate, toasted nuts, and coffee melt waft over the papery vanilla smell of your book and the bitter almond posies of heliotrope on each table. Now imagine the undertow of a really good sandalwood that smells like salty butter and sweet cream. It really doesn't get better than this if you love grown-up, unisex gourmands."," Rum, sugar cane, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, almond, heliotrope, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Citizen X Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Los Angeles, after dark. The terrace of a suspended villa above the City of Angels. Suddenly, a beam of intense light runs on the skin and makes you shiver. This is the concept of Citizen X, Ex Nihilo's newest and most contemporary masculine, a ""frozen amber"" that glows with bracing intensity. Citizen X opens with a piercing shot of resinous mastic and white pepper exciting the senses. Like a sharp detonation that gives way to a diffuse explosion, perfumer Yann Vasnier deftly blends in an enveloping iris note that softens and sustains the scent's icy disposition. Soon enough, the atmosphere turns musky, difficult to pinpoint, with tendrils of incense through ambered woods. This is a fragrance for the glamorous and confident, the stylish and powerful, the ones who truly wake up once the sun has set. Modern, masculine, and ever so slightly dangerous- the world belongs to Citizen X."," Mastic tree, white pepper, iris, incense, ambery woods, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bracken Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Inspired by 1960s counterculture, Bracken is an elegantly wild concoction for the modern hippie. A smoky, herbal potion with sweet woodland flowers and wild berries, Bracken Woman opens with a delicious clash of ferny green notes and tangy red fruit juices. Then, a rush of herbal and floral aromas tumble together for a love-in with smoky, birchy leather. In the middle stage, the loamy aroma of damp earth is joined by patchouli, and the florals intensify, giving an impression of moist tobacco and crushed blossoms.Bracken Woman eventually relaxes into a woody green floral. But it stays very much a creature of the forest: earthy, verdant and more than a bit mysterious. For those craving the natural romance of the Summer of Love but aren't willing to compromise on sophistication, Bracken Woman is here to deliver flower power--with style."," Bracken accord, wild berries, lily, narcissus, chamomile, smoky leather accord, patchouli, vetiver, birch",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41884.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Brooklyn Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," The beating creative heart of the East Coast, Brooklyn is a borough crackling with excitement and youthful joy. Power walking to a breakfast meeting over the Brooklyn Bridge. Life on the sidewalk, early summer breezes, the glow from the lighting in bars and diners, bright apartments stuffed with books. Cocktails with friends. A lazy May afternoon in the sun at Park Slope, warmth on the skin. Small flowers in the grass. Fresh air. These are the scents reflected in Brooklyn, a musky citrus tinged with crackling spice and the deep ozone of life in the midst of one of the world's busiest cities. Energetic with a creative and intellectual fizz, Brooklyn will have you feeling like you're in the very center of the cultural universe."," Bergamot, squeezed lemon, orange juice, incense, cardamom, fresh air, ozonic notes, magnolia, orris root, transparent flowers, musks, white woods, benzoin, amber.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Istanbul Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," Istanbul- an ancient city teeming with freshness and modernity. Old luxury meeting new confidence. The exact spot where two continents, and two cultures, meet, with every result you could imagine. With Istanbul, Gallivant celebrates this thrilling, august, contradictory city in all its complication and glory, delivering a rich, ostensibly masculine scent that would also wear stunningly sexy on any woman, rich in creamy coffee, suede leather, incense and exotic spice, sweet and rich, yet subtly powdery and nimble, dignified but far from stolid. Waking up in Moda, crossing the Bosphorus for a balmy night in KarakÃ¶y- a fragrance as dynamic and intriguing as Istanbul itself."," Bergamot, cardamom, red thyme, lavender absolute, egyptian geranium essence, patchouli heart, sweet myrrh, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, amber, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
London Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," London- a massive city that sometimes feels like a small town. Soaring buildings abut down-to-earth pubs. Overwhelming, but inexplicably addictive. And, as much as the Brits have a well-earned reputation for stuffiness, it's all tied together with a wicked sense of humor. Where else can you find such a sea of humanity, east end boys and west end girls in second-hand leather jackets, the creative, the new, old, the beautiful, the ugly, the rich and the poor, all just rubbing along and making their way in one of the world's true capitals? Gallivant presents a particularly unique olfactive portrait of London- a wet spring, where roses from Columbia Rd. radiate from courtyard gardens, bouncing off the dustiness of Georgian architecture, embracing an earthy lush wetness that makes it feel as if the city grew organically from British soil. Richly floral, deeply intoxicating, London is the spirit of the United Kingdom."," Cucumber, violet leaves, rose de mai, rose oil, orris root, leather, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tel Aviv Eau de Parfum,Gallivant," A true mixture of Mediterranean elegance, modern Middle East heat, and cosmopolitan cool, Tel Aviv is like nowhere else on Earth. It's bright white sun, gold jewelry on tanned skin, a lingering 1970's glamour. It's sexy, it's a party, it's life in the bubble. It's walking along the beach, naked skin, feeling relaxed, with the big city bustling right next door, full of noise, people and mad intensity. it's stopping at the juice stall on Dizengoff, smelling the fresh clementines and sweet stone fruits. It's the heat, the sweat, the cigarette smoke, and the sweet florals from the overhead balconies, all sewn together with the warm musk of human flesh and youthful energy."," Clementine, bergamot, blackcurrant bud, jasmine sambac, ylang ylang, rose oil, freesia, sandalwood, musks, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Tosca Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Shockingly violent, sweeping and modern when it premiered, Puccini's Tosca was a true spectacle, drawing heated and mixed critical reaction- and the absolute adoration of the public, who flocked to its every sold-out performance. Having already been transformed into an Italian-language opera from a French-language play, Tosca's further transformation into a perfume with cross-border influence seems all too appropriate, and so it may come as no surprise that it's a crowd-pleasing success- a colorful, broadly painted grand-dame floral mixing freshness and lusciousness, bright herbal tones and smooth vanilla creaminess, for a truly romantic work of art. Many fragrances claim to be operatic, but Tosca, with its crisp and green citrus opening, herbaceous floral heart, and rich drydown, really does feel like a scent in three distinct, yet connected, acts, guiding us on an ever-moving emotional journey that twists, turns, and ultimately uplifts the spirit."," Italian lemon, green manadarin, Bulgarian rose, eucalyptus, violet leaves, patchouli, musk, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mirabilis Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Elegant in its simplicity, Mirabilis is the Natura Fabularis collection's and perfumer Daphne Bugey's attempt to tackle one of man's deepest questions- nature vs science- with a clever, fragrant twist. Here, the debate between the rational and the spiritual plays out in Bugey's choice of ingredients, with the natural world represented first via a rich, gently earthy incense, the most fundamental of all perfume ingredients, recalling ancient devotionals and primal understandings. Then, the scientific comes into focus, combining the comforting cleanness of Ambrox with Vulcanolide, a cutting edge synthetic musk with earthy and amber facets. The result is a fragrance that wears lightly, but not weakly- there's an elemental power beneath the surface, humming with clean energy, but also just enough earthiness to never fully leave the natural realm. Part rational, part spiritual, Mirabilis is a true reconciliation between reason and belief.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Ambrox, incense, white musk vulcanolide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arcana Rosa Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," There's no shortage of pithy phrases involving roses and thorns, but you'd never know it by smelling the bland softness of most mass market rose fragrances. Luckily, Arcana Rosa's thorns are front and center, hardened over an open cedar fire and spiked with rooty vetiver and prickly cade. Through the smoke, a lush, beautifully full bodied Bulgarian rose still asserts its beauty, but the woods and resins transmute its strength into something of awe and danger, a rose equally at home on a man or woman. We're not surprised that the Natura Fabularis collection needed a rose. We're simply grateful that they decided that they decided that the same old rose just wouldn't do.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Rose, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, cade, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tenebrae Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Tenebrae, as the official text from the Natura Fabularis collection describes it, is the scent of a ""dark and shadowy forest"" so overgrown that light barely peeks through the treetops, and we certainly wouldn't disagree. But in true fairy tale fashion, this forest hides not only mysterious dangers, represented with dark resins and woods, but also mystical wonders, in the form of a marvelously sweet and complex crystallized sap note that combines with a not-too-heavy dose of incense. The result is a fragrance that lifts us upwards, letting us know that the sun is still there, even if we can't quite see it.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Incense, resin, sap",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
You Or Someone Like You Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," If Etat Libre d'Orange had set out specifically to make a fragrance that would delight us here at Luckyscent, they still probably couldn't top You Or Someone Like You. Dedicated to our hometown of Los Angeles? Check. Creative directed by our good friend and collaborator Chandler Burr and named after his L.A.-based novel? Check. And most importantly, the kind of fresh, crisply cool niche scent that's oh so wonderfully easy to wear in any situation, yet distinct and head-turning? In a city where deals are made poolside and boardroom meetings might feature more denim than Italian wool, that's a big, important check. While they're keeping the official notes a secret, we're buzzing off You Or Someone Like You's sharp, fruity opening and ultra-fresh mint and floral body--it really does evoke one of our favorite L.A. experiences- sipping a drink on the wraparound balcony of a party palace in the hills, taking in our big, weird, wonderful city.  Come to think of it, did ELDO and Chandler make this scent just for us?",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47748.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violaceum Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," It takes all of a second for the beauty of a flower to topple over in the darkness. Composed for L'Artisan Parfumeur's exclusive collection, Natura Fabularis, Violaceum pays tribute to the ephemeral character of nature. In the shade of a forest lies a carpet of violets. Despite their delicate nature, these flowers are not prone to sentimentality. The usually powdery sensation is replaced by an impression of leather. The perfumer, DaphnÃ© Bugey, creates confusion and depth by combining the violet, cousin of the iris, to an accord of carrot and saffron. A simple flower can no longer be perceived, and instead, a complex and poetic blend comes together, where gastronomy and the floral arts meet in two distinct new accords: carrot-saffron and leathery-violet. As Violaceum deepens on the skin, it resonates with poetic clarity- classic and contemporary all at once.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Carrot, saffron, leather, violet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Venenum Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Somewhere between gourmand and oriental, exotic and comforting, light and dark, lies Venenum, the Natura Fabularis collection's ode to the beautiful aromas and ingredients of India. Blending captivating notes of deep, smooth sandalwood, milky and spicy chai tea, and steamed rice, Venenum is an intriguing chameleon, oscillating between the mouthwatering and the romantic with delightful playfulness, conjuring broadly painted visions of sunsets over Lake Pichola and elaborately lovely high tea ceremonies, adventures as relaxing as they are exciting. We may not be able to precisely categorize Venenum, but there's one word that perfectly describes it: beautiful.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Masala chai, rice, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nisean Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Powerful, elegant and confidently exotic, Nisean is a masculine oriental with refinement to spare. Named for a legendary breed of ancient Persian horse, Nisean features an effortless balance of smoky, spicy, and woodsy notes, for a stylish and striking gentleman who knows how to leave a lasting impression.Nisean opens with a rich burst of resinous florals and sweet woods balanced with a rich vein of saffron, imbuing a familiar set of notes with uncommonly refined quality. As the deep, earthy patchouli emerges to balance the sweetness, an airy incense-like quality emanates forth, keeping everything balanced with surprising agility. Yes, you've smelled a masculine oriental before. But Nisean, with its power, dignity and subtlety, towers above its competitors."," Saffron, labdanum, flowers, patchouli, precious woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Feu Secret Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Of the four grades of fire with which the ancient alchemists worked,  the primary one for the true alchemist was the Secret Fire – the fire that was able to affect matter without having a physical presence itself.  It is the“serpentine working power in the body, ” the electro-spiritual,  creative life force of the alchemist himself.  The acclaimed artist-perfumer Bruno Fazzolari has brought the secret fire to life in this shape-shifting ode to the orris root. Feu Secret opens with a bright-cold burst of pink pepper and eucalyptus that lifts the orris root to the sun,  almost mimicking a citrus note. This is no earthy-cold iris – if anything,  the spices bring out the hidden warmth of the orris butter,  melting into the skin. The transformative nature of the iris comes out in the heart,  not lipstick-violet in any mortal way,  but ethereally smoky,  reaching its roots into the earth. Reducing all other attempts at rooty orris to mere sweet carrots,  rising tendrils of birch tar smoke give way to a gauzy,  woody veil,  enthroned in vanilla and cedar. The vibrant life energy is properly interpreted here,  by turns airy,  fiery,  and earthy on the skin.  As a divine incantation,  Feu Secret is surprisingly androgynous and sublimely distinctive."," Hemlock spruce, eucalyptus, iris, turmeric, pink pepper, Himalayan cedar, birch tar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69308.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc Gold Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," In an era where modern fragrance can feel cold, distant and minimalist, Bruno Acampora presents us with bold, baroque beauty. Musc Gold is an homage to the house's most undeniable classic, a warm, sensual, complex musk scent that captures the high-art-meets-casual-cool sensibility of Southern Italy. In this gorgeous new version, the original earthy smoothness of Acampora's original is preserved, but supplemented with a contemporary, slightly bitter twist of lavender, injecting both energy and a subtle masculinity. Don't worry- women and men alike can- and should- wear this on any and every occasion."," Musk, honeyed florals, neroli, rose, jasmine, violet, vanilla, amber, lavender, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37537.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cypress Shade Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," More shade than cypress, Cypress Shade is so astonishingly good at capturing the cool, herbal dampness of the ground under a cypress tree that you might want to curl up and take a little nap. Take a good book with you, and a glass of ice-cold Pastis.The mastic woodiness of the cypress does not dominate, forming instead a softly green, balsamic curtain through which the other notes shine. Fresh mint, vetiver, and coriander form a cooling mat of aromatic grasses that is as welcome on a hot day as a cool cloth on the forehead. The unmistakable licorice snap of anise darts and weaves through the damp green notes, turning the mind most pleasurably to the midday aperitif. But what elevates this scent beyond the standard woody aromatic is the mimosa, a powdery yellow flower that smells like almond flour, glue, cucumber, and innocence itself. The mimosa sparkles before folding itself into a vigorous base of Madagascaran cedar and Haitian vetiver. It ends, as all things should, in the milky, anise-tinted blur of Pastis."," Lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dates Delight Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Are you the kind of person who looks at the dessert list before choosing the appetizers? Well, then welcome to the most sumptuous dessert trolley you've ever set eyes on – Dates Delight. Imagine a gold dish piled high with sticky RiyÃ  dates as plump as a baby's fist and dripping with raw honey and caramel. Now picture them dunked into a bath of the silkiest crÃ¨me brulee, thick with vanilla bean underneath and crackling with melted brown sugar on top. Visualize all this dusted with a thick layer of spicy cinnamon. Are you salivating yet? Thankfully, although this scent is delicious it stops short of total gluttony because of the inedible elements at play. So while the honey and dates may make your mouth water, the coumarin, with its nuances of warm, pungent hay, bitter almonds, and tobacco makes you hesitate to put it in your mouth. Benzoin and labdanum add smoke, leather, and a hint of tar that reins it in even further. Even the soapy little peony note up top whispers, don't eat me. It's this level of abstraction that balances the scent, and renders it sophisticated. Fans of Oajan by Parfums de Marly and Ambre Narguile by Hermes will feel right at home here."," Peony, dates, coumarin, caramel, tonka, cinnamon, honey, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Golden Powder Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Although strictly speaking the name Golden Powder refers to a meditation technique that opens up the chest to rays of chakra-cleansing light, we kind of prefer to think that the name really is a sly nod to those famous“golden dust” attars for which the Middle East and India are famous – beautifully warm, resinous ambers with nuances of tobacco, cinnamon, and vanilla-soaked wood.Golden Powder is a luxury rendition of this oriental theme, taking it to a richer, more refined level. The first impression is of dry woods, flurries of dusty cinnamon and nutmeg swirling around tough Virginian cedar and robust tobacco leaf. But then a cinnamon-apple amber and golden vanilla swells up from underneath, folding the woods, tobacco, and spice into a room-filling crescendo of creamy sweetness. Oriental, yes, but as user-friendly as a Golden Retriever. Fans of Kalemat and Raghba looking for an upgrade may want to try this on for size."," Nutmeg, cinnamon, sandalwood, guaiac wood, cedar, papyrus, musk, labdanum, vanilla, coumarin, tobacco blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grape Pearls Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Oh my. Intense CafÃ© met Botrytis and they made a baby. A stunning“fall harvest” fragrance, Grape Pearls strikes a perfect balance between the honeyed freshness of flowers and the earthier smells of the land as it gives up its yield. The opening notes of fruit and red wine transport us to the packing shed, where the crates of freshly-picked grapes are stacked one on top of another. These smell of ripe grapes and red berries, but also of wine must, honey, and old wood - olfactory memories of the harvests of yesteryear. Then we are transported outside, to the orchard, among wicker baskets overflowing with blueberries and deep, blowsy roses. A waft of freshly roasted coffee beans snakes through the vines and mingles with the fruit and flowers, bringing with it the promise of a rest. Hot coffee taken in companionable silence with one's fellow workers, surrounded by the smells of the harvest, and all wrapped up in a silky amber and vanilla accord that feels like a soft bed after a long day. Now what on earth could be more satisfying than that?"," Floral notes, blueberry, grape, grape leaf, rose, coffee, amber, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Almond Harmony Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by the early blossoms of the almond tree, which signify resurrection and the dawning of life, Almond Harmony is a beautifully constructed floral oriental that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. Opening with a joyous burst of sweet, fresh almond supported by creamy orange blossom, Almond Harmony seamlessly layers on a gorgeous floral bouquet in the heart, weaving the sweetness of ylang and the distinctly almond tones of heliotrope with smooth jasmine and powdery iris. In the deep, balsamic base, gentle touches of oud and musk introduce a hint of sensuality, while never compromising the fresh, genuine spirit of the scent. Optimistic, vibrant and downright lovely, Almond Harmony is an unexpected  pleasure."," Orange blossom, almond, iris, jasmine, heliotrope, ylang-ylang, tolu balsam, tonka bean, musk, vanilla, peru balsam, Burma oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blessing Silence Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," The age-old pairing of rose, oud, and patchouli....you might have heard this tune before, but when it's done as right as Blessing Silence, it's as revelatory as listening to a Justin Bieber tune sung by Placido Domingo. Good materials make all the difference. Right out of the gate, you notice the tight balance between four big power players – the deeply tarry, leathery labdanum, the burning oud chip note, the beefy rose, and the pungent patchouli. The powerful notes try at first to duke it out, each hoping to emerge as alpha dog, but in the end, they call a truce. What emerges from the tussle is an incredibly rich, oozing animalic accord of earth, rot, smoke, rose, leather, and resin. It's an aroma as ancient as perfume itself, a word which, after all, means“through the smoke”. One sniff of this heavenly potion and you will be whisked away to a Sultan's palace where they are fumigating his robes and rooms with Kyara from the jungles of Vietnam. Fans of the rich, smoking oud wood note in Leather Oud and Oud Palao will find their Jannah, or heaven, in Blessing Silence."," Labdanum, patchouli, sandalwood, rose, Indi oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Breath Of The Infinite Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by that tremulous moment when our world first came to be, Breath of the Infinite is an attempt to capture in fragrance form the smell of space particles and stars colliding in an explosion so colossal that it makes the universe contract and hold its breath. The fragrance itself is as cloudy and as abstract as the aftermath.It's not an easy one to describe. A mixture of peppery, raw ambroxan and woody musk forms a nebulous background against which tiny starbursts of peony and freesia pop like soap bubbles. It feels both as spare and modern as a Giacometti sculpture, and as ancient as a piece of driftwood on the beach. Black pepper, metal, dust, salt, wood, and the sensuous, latex-like slip of cashmeran in the base – as elemental as time itself. If you love scents like L'Antimatiere that keep you guessing, then head on over to the ultra-mysterious Breath of the Infinite."," Peony, freesia, peach, musk, ambroxan, cashmeran, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Clandestine Clara Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Rebellious, contradictory, independent, unconventional- these are the words Penhaligon's uses to describe Clara, the latest character in their Portraits saga- the illicit mistress to Lord George. And true to form, Clara's fragrance could be described much the same way, as a boozy, smoky, smoothly woodsy feminine scent that's not for the faint of heart, but is sure to command the attention of sophisticated thrill-seekers. Spicy and sweet in equal measure, Clandestine Clara layered rich, smooth rhum vanilla over musky cinnamon, creating a true gourmand that nonetheless never feels simple, dessert-y or girlish- due, perhaps, to the complex ambered patchouli in the base. Is Clandestine Clara a challenging fragrance? We'd have to say so- but as Lord George can confirm, it's a challenge bound to seduce."," Rhum vanilla, cinnamon musk, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Riviere Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," In the world of fine jewelry, a RiviÃ¨re is a classic necklace comprised of seamlessly graduated gemstones, such as the stunning and oft-photographed set of old cut diamonds famously passed down from Queen Mary to Princess Margaret. To translate this timeless and elegant design to the world of fragrance, Thameen has constructed a shimmering, balanced scent that showcases a flawless progression of rare and sparkling ingredients combined to adorn the skin. Riviere opens with an arresting sparkle, showcasing spicy notes of Indian black pepper and Persian saffron that melt into rich cinnamon and luminously warm lemon blossom. Behind the dazzle, a rich and sophisticated heart of clary sage over lush rose and carnation balance atop a warm, gently earthy patchouli. An iridescent base of golden amber and smooth oud layered atop glowing leather give the scent resinous heat and elegant, mysterious brilliance. With each exceptional ingredient leading seamlessly into the next, Riviere is a masterclass in fragrance construction, a scent that fits together so perfectly that its true sophistication must be experienced to be understood."," Black pepper, cinnamon, saffron, lemon blossom, clary sage, carnation, rose, patchouli, oud, leather, cypriol, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

We're not talking about an overdose of girly,  cookie cutter fruity-florals,  or a powder-drenched grandma scent,  but rather,  in D.S. & Durga's own words,  ""palatial doses of the finest floral absolutes, "" a no-costs-spared approach to creating the ultimate limited-edition fragrance. So what does it feel like? Rapturous. Durga opens with eye-widening,  mouthwatering freshness,  the bite of green tuberose with the smooth refreshness of melon. The heart,  however,  is where the uncompromising abundance of luxurious florals elevates Durga above most any we've smelled: soft,  lovely chrysanthemum,  velvety sweet ylang,  narcotic white florals and an unfathomably rich dose of orris deliver a stunning bouquet that has to be experienced. We've encountered many florals varieties over the years; Durga belongs on a short and rarified list."," Green tuberose, melon, chrysanthemum, ylang-ylang, orris butter, orange blossom, tuberose, jasmine, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Noir 29 Perfume Oil,Le Labo," ThÃ© Noir 29 is an ode to the noble tea leaf and the craft that surrounds it. Combining depth and freshness, softness and strength, this uncharacteristically structured wonder stuns us through permanent oscillation between the light of bergamot, fig, and bay leaf, and the depth of cedar, vetiver and musk. A special extraction of black tea leaves wraps up the composition by bringin a dry, leafy, hay-like tobacco feeling in the dry down to transform this creation into a sensuous and addictive essence.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Black tea leaves, bergamot, fig, cedar, vetiver, bay leaf, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46870.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aqua Celestia Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," While his beloved creations now span across every conceivable fragrance family, from gourmand orientals to dark, modern florals, we'll always think of Francis Kurkdjian first and foremost as the creator of impossibly lovely, ultra-fresh musks that you'd wish your entire life could smell like. And with Aqua Celestia, the master gives us another all-encompassing musk obsession, a rich yet delicate blend of air and sea freshness, spiked with lime and cool mint, caressed by tart, juicy blackcurrant, softened with deliciously full mimosa blossoms from ProvenÃ§e. Plenty of fragrances advertise themselves as versatile, but you genuinely can't go wrong here- spray it over jeans and a t-shirt for a casually sexy burst of style, marvel at how intimate and confident it presents with formalwear, or even spritz it over your sheets for a truly lovely slumber. Francis Kurkdjian will doubtlessly continue to innovate and push boundaries as his legend grows ever larger, but between us, we hope he never abandons lovely, perfectly fresh scents like Aqua Celestia."," Lime, cool mint mitcham, blackcurrant bud absolute, mimosa absolute, musk accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49871.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dandelion Fig Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," Shay & Blue are the masters of the fresh, modern fragrance that says what it needs to say with admirable directness. Dandelion and Fig is no exception – if you are looking for something that combines the herbal freshness of an English garden with a sly twist of colonial exoticism, then look no further. Here the sharp green snap of tomato leaf mingles with the bracing hotness of lemongrass, a pleasing hybrid between an ice-cold Pimm's and a Thai curry that makes perfect sense when you smell it. Ever crush dandelion stalks between your fingers as a kid? The clever juxtaposition of soft and sharp green notes in this scent nails that smell. Add the gin-and-tonic fizz of juniper berry and the wilted green sweetness of fig leaf, and what we have is the perfect tonic for cooling one's brow under the hot midday sun. Bottoms up!"," Dandelion leaf, lemongrass, tomato vine, juniper, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70416.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rhinoceros Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Across the savanna, in the dry heat of midday, aromas of parched grasses and campfire woods crackle in the arid air. A stir of something densely animalic causes nearby sandpipers to lift their heads in alarm. The rhino lowers his head, and smaller creatures scatter.Rhinoceros is an animalic fougere that charges in headfirst with uncompromisingly butch notes of tannic leather and rum.  But this rough beast hides a gentlemanly heart.  The rough, raw leather of the opening is gradually smoothed out by herbal-tonic notes of lavender, sage and geranium. Leaving the African veldt for a wood-paneled library, our horned friend invites us to settle down with a leather-bound volume and a pipe of rich, moist tobacco. A bit fierce when you first meet him, Rhinoceros shows himself to be a creature of great refinement."," Rum, bergamot, lavender, elemi, sage, armoise, conifer needles, pinewood, tobacco, immortelle, geranium, agarwood, cedar, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, smoke, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Macaque Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," Macaque, that most playful of primates, starts with a bit of mischief. Tangy, off-sweet mandarin and green apple run smack into a startlingly vibrant galbanum that picks them up and shakes them by the scruff. But before the galbanum can get the upper hand, the fruit is bolstered by grassy green and jasmine teas and a rather serious cedar, which calms the bite of the galbanum.  At this stage, Macaque seems to be an on its way to becoming an eccentrically fetching green perfume. But what happens next makes Macaque a true original.The vivid fruit and green notes spread out, becoming less opaque, as ceremonial aromas of smoky incense and oud start to rise. Macaque transforms from impish volley between tree fruit and vegetation to a dialogue between the contemplative and spiritual and the primal. In the dry-down, mossy and woody aromas meld with the bright notes of Macaque's opening, creating an interplay of wildness and meditative that is as provocative as it is soothing."," Cedar, green apple, red mandarin, frankincense, galbanum, honey, rosewood, ylang, jasmine tea, cedarmoss, green tea, white oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nightingale Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," If the thickest fuchsia silk could be encapsulated in perfume, it would smell like Nightingale, Zoologist's floral chypre. A startlingly beautiful Japanese plum blossom top note is supported by a deeply lush rose and fresh green violet. Balanced by spritely citrus and woody notes, Nightingale soars between airy and opulent.As Nightingale trills her eloquent flowery song, nighttime fragrances of incense and light oud permeate the composition, lending a mysterious, twilight quality. In the dry down, oakmoss and patchouli brings the scents of ancient trees and damp earth as Nightingale's serenade quiets.  Sensual, rich and serenely lovely, Nightingale is a rare bird."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, Japanese plum blossom, rose, violet, oud, patchouli, sandalwood, moss, frankincense, white musk, labdanum, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hummingbird Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," Nectarous honeysuckle and yellow mimosa flutter in the air to the beat of a thousand tiny wings, their honeyed bouquet summoning tiny, extravagant birds to feed. Moments later, crystalline muguet, lilac and peony begin to float around trees heavy with fruit, as birds and insects buzz dizzily in the morning heat. Hummingbird, Zoologist's ode to the jeweled avian, is a lovely floral that, like its namesake, is at once sumptuous and ethereal.  As it opens, a giddy host of spring flowers swirls around rich honeyed notes. Pears and green plums, dripping with sweet juice, tantalize as Hummingbird's blooms open in quick succession, each flower's characteristics instantly recognizable. Alighting on a rich base of sweet amber and white woods in the dry-down, Hummingbird is simply one of the prettiest florals around."," Apple, cherry, citrus, lilac, muguet, plum, rose, violet leaf, honey, honeysuckle, mimosa, peony, tulip, ylang, amber, coumarin, cream, moss, musk, sandalwood, white woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beaver Eau de Parfum,Zoologist," A dewy, saturated green floral with aquatic notes, Beaver is a serene drift down a lazy river. The honeyed richness of linden blossoms floats deliriously over bracing ozonic notes, as Beaver sets out on its languid journey.  Then, a strange, complex green note, half vegetation, half herbal and utterly compelling, swims up through the linden. Beaver becomes lusher, linden mingling with scents of driftwood and foliage.As it moves downstream towards the base notes, Beaver changes tide, its watery notes receding in favor of animalic aspects. Smooth, sueded leather emerges and mingles with soft, furry musks and a tang of castoreum as Beaver reveals a more wanton side. Verdant, refined and just this side of lusty, Beaver turns out to be the naughtiest green floral we've encountered for some time."," Linden blossom, fresh outdoor air, wood shavings, wild vegetation, damp air, dry wood, water, musk, dark woods, vanilla, amber, castoreum, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Civet Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist," An homage to the ingredient that gave that deliciously naughty, animalic note to the great elegant perfumes of the 30s and 40s, such as Rochas Femme and Schiaparelli Shocking, Civet is a gorgeous retro-style chypre. Civet's zingy opening makes her seem like a modern gal, thanks to a vigorous citrus-pepper top note and herbal bite. Then, a plethora of heady floral notes swan in: heliotrope, linden, and hyacinth, creating a perfume of almost unbearable loveliness.Civet could have stopped right there and remained breathtakingly pretty. But she has darker motives and starts to undress, revealing her voluptuousness with fleshy ylang ylang and tuberose. That animalic touch of those yesteryear beauties is there as you would expect, and gives Civet its low growl. But a slow-blooming, deep red carnation lends Civet its vintage charm. The spicy flower opens up in the middle stages, revealing a classically pretty bloom, creamy with hints of clove and green stem. When it finally stretches out on a gourmand bed of coffee, vanilla and incense, Civet purrs like a contented kitten."," Bergamot, black pepper, lemon, orange, spices, tarragon, carnation, frangipani, heliotrope, hyacinth, linden blossom, tuberose, ylang, balsams, civet, coffee, incense, labdanum, musks, oakmoss, resins, Russian leather, vanilla, vetiver, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cacti Eau de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," Many of the Huichols and North American peyotists claim that when one eats peyote, one is tasting oneself: ""If the user is pure, this cactus is sweet.""  – Peter Stafford, author of Psychedelics EncyclopediaCacti is a vivid, crisp and quenching scent, loaded with mouthwatering notes of cucumber, matÃ©, aloe vera, and an exquisitely juicy essential oil of pure Italian bergamot. Delicately sweet and light florals float almost weightlessly, while a surprisingly cool-inflected Baltic amber provides depth and backbone without adding a hint of heaviness. Like any good peyote experience, this wondrous skin scent doesn't so much cover you up as much as reveal your best, truest self."," Italian bergamot essential oil, shiso, black tea, jasmine sambac absolute, heliotrope, cucumber water, matÃ© absolute, Baltic amber, aloe vera",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Glass Blooms Eau de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," ""[These] flower petals look as if they'd quiver at the nearby buzzing of a bee. As botanical specimens they can be admired; as glass replicas, they are wondrous."" – Edward Rothstein, cultural critic, on the 19th-century botanical studies of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka at CambridgeA delicate floral constructed to celebrate the beauty of fragility, Glass Blooms is every bit as intricately constructed as the faux petals of its namesake. Softly juicy white grape opens into satin-smooth florals, played at a deliberate low hum, rich, sweet and whisper-quiet. Smooth, comforting musk rolls in like the caress of fog, weightless and gentle. Like the silent ghost of a once-grandiose floral, Glass Blooms is an object of fascination and vulnerable beauty."," Riesling grape, muguet, tea rose, peony, ylang ylang (from Nosy Be island) sandalwood, tonka bean absolute, ambrette and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Kismet Eau de Parfum,Lubin," ""Folly!"" That's how the elderly owner of the Lubin Perfume House, Monsieur Paul Prot, described the elephant-shaped perfume bottle that had appeared on his desk. It had been designed for a princess.  Spiritual and multilingual, Kismet cultivated the mystery surrounding her background. She reigned over the Parisian parties of the Roaring Twenties for a time, then one day slipped away, never to be seen again. All that remained was the memory of the scent that Lubin had created for her.And what a scent it is- lush and heady, sweet and intoxicating, wedding the vivacious freshness of bergamot, lemon and nose-tingling petitgrain to a velvety menagerie of exquisite types of rose, all set against smooth, creamy vanilla and sumptuously sensual patchouli and myrrh. Like the now faded-to-legend princess, this Kismet is at once seductive and delightful, exotic and familiar, and altogether ravishing. Another touch of vintage elegance from the house of Lubin."," Bergamot, lemon, petitgrain, Rose Centifolia, Bulgarian rose, patchouli, labdanum cistus, opoponax, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Clementine California Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," In terms of sheer, natural joy, how many sensations can truly compare to the first bite of a perfectly ripe clementine? The visceral satisfaction as the skin of the fruit gives way, the effervescent spritz of fresh citrus atomized into the air, the indulgent rush of fresh, sweet juice running down your chin- this is the sensation perfectly captured in Clementine California, a marvel of a new fragrance from Atelier Cologne that will leave you pining for the Golden State. And while the first spray is a Proustian marvel, instantly drawing you back to your sunniest childhood memory, the remainder of the fragrance is equally wonderful, as an unexpected but only gently fiery heart of aromatic spices lend beautiful texture, keeping the front of the nose engaged long after the initial jolt of citrus has settled, and setting the stage for a naturally woodsy base featuring zingy vetiver. Lively and fresh, juicy and vibrant, Clementine California is substantial enough to cut through the cold when you're pining for the West Coast, but shimmering enough to rock with style when you actually make it out here."," Clementine, mandarin, juniper berries, star anise, Sichuan pepper, basil, vetiver, sandalwood, cypress",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51034.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bass Solo Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Inspired by Wendge, the beautifully dark-grained African wood whose dense timber makes it coveted for the crafting of musical instruments, Bass Solo, the newest scent from The Vagabond Prince, is truly a virtuosic work. While Wenge doesn't have an aroma of its own, its combination of beauty and function inspired master perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour to fashion a fragrance that itself extracts deep and vibrant accords hidden within its notes. Like the profound resonance of the titular instrument, Bass Solo offers an aroma pitched in the lowest register, its dense melody composed of a selection of exquisite woody notes including soft sandalwood, salty driftwood, and a blend of cedars with warm, comfortable, dry nuances. Smoky tar and velvety peach flow through the striations, while a light floral cardamom combines with the woodsy warmth to softly caress the wearer. Meanwhile a higher pich of lavender represents the cold metal of the strings, bringing spice and wood together to create magic. Sleek yet deep, beautiful yet powerful, Bass Solo represents a bold new evolution for The Vagabond Prince, and is as striking a scent as we've encountered all year."," Saffron, ginger, lime, cardamom, lavender, Moroccan cedar, Virginia cedar, fig milk, birch tar, sandalwood, amber, driftwood, wenge accord, musk, oppoponax, amyris, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

11 Eau de Parfum,Boris Bidjan Saberi," Boris Bidjan Saberi has never been known for conservatism- his edgy, modern designs and provocative collections have raised eyebrows and thrilled fashion-lovers, all while maintaining an exceptional level of detail-oriented artisanal craftsmanship. So it's only fitting that for his debut fragrance 11, Saberi, in collaboration with Geza Schoen, has created a vibrant, stylish scent bursting with creativity. Inspired by Saberi's leatherwork studio, where he hand-constructs intricate horse leather jackets, this scent reflects the care, personality, and style that Boris imprints into every item he produces. While it might seem like this would result in a heavy, challengingly industrial fragrance, Geza Schoen has instead crafted a dynamically casual, everyday leather scent that we find surprisingly soft and fresh. An initial whiff of freshly cut grass slowly dissipates into something more craftsmanlike, a smooth, supple but substantial leather with hints of wax and glue to give it a playful and creative character. 11 wears with easygoing unisex modernity, masculine and refined on a man, chic and sexy on a woman. Whether you're a leather fanatic chasing the next innovation, or simply looking for that one scent that just goes with everything, we urge you not to miss this one.", 11 select (but undisclosed!) notes that evoke vegetable tanned horse leather,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Au Dela Narcisse Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," When we released the original Au DelÃ ,  we praised it as a ""big,  ravishingly spicy floral with a knockout drydown, "" the kind of throwback chypre that proved not only that Bruno Fazzolari had the chops to take on a titan of the classical French perfume style,  but to make it his own with a uniquely lively,  American aplomb. With Au DelÃ  Narcisse,  Fazzolari takes his old-school chypre- made with genuine oakmoss and labdanum- and adds a stunning dose of rare,  exquisite narcissus that is clear,  fresh,  and unmistakable. Atop a classic base,  richly spicy and resinous with just the right amount of animalistic purr,  Au DelÃ  Narcisse feels vintage and classic in all the right ways- but fresh,  modern and exciting in many others. One thing we know for sure: this is Bruno Fazzolari's best work yet."," Bergamot, narcissus, jasmine, oakmoss, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69307.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Contre Bombarde 32 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Contre Bombarde 32 is a paean to the centuries-old aromas of resins, wax, and old wood ingrained in the ancient organ at Notre Dame. The sharp, resinous topnotes of bitter orange peel, elemi, and juniper captures perfectly the smell of unburned resins and wet stone that lingers in gloomy European cathedrals. Musky, spicy cedar wood supplies the almost animalistic scent of old wood that rises from the grain of wooden church pews when rubbed. A smoked toffee amber brings up the rear, giving us a surprising flourish of sweetness that somehow totally works. A brooding, atmospheric scent that balances the rough with the smooth, Contre Bombarde 32 could well be the Heathcliff of incense fragrances."," Elemi, juniper, bitter orange, cedar, sandalwood, amber, caramel, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Plein Jeu III-V Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Plein Jeu III-V opens with a soft lemon and ginger pairing that lends an aromatic lightness to the oily black pepper and cold, green frankincense. A wreath of fresh white jasmine and powdery, fluffy mimosa forms a frothy halo around the darker myrrh and balsam notes, lifting the accords into the air like notes of music. Filippo says that this scent was inspired by an endless dance of angels, and we can see that. It is as airborne as a curl of white smoke in a dark space."," Lemon, ginger, mimosa, black pepper, amber, olibanum, jasmine, cedar, balsam fir, myrrh, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Voix Humaine 8 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Voix Humaine 8 is inspired by Vox Humana, a type of reed stop on the organ designed to impressionistically imitate the human voice. When pressed, this stop has the tone of a soprano hitting a high note, a sound that seems to linger in the air long after the other notes fade. Accordingly, Voix Humaine 8 takes dry, peppery incense and infuses it with a cool, white floral milk, giving it the sweet edge of a singed marshmallow. Musky ambrette seed and a mousseline accord lend the texture a cashmere softness that tempers the dark incense. If you take your incense with a dash of cream and sugar, then make this a priority."," Bergamot, cardamom, elemi, ambrette, jasmine, orange blossom, amber, leather, olibanum, milk mousse, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mississippi Medicine Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga," Tribal pyres burning in the forests, with smoke from pine, holly, cypress, laurel, and cedar rising upwards to the gods.  D.S.& Durga looked to the funerary rituals of the early Mississippian Death Cult, the loosely connected network of tribes in America's regions around the 1200 AD, as the inspirations for the haunting yet comfortingly earthy Mississippi Medicine.This Pocket Perfume is a 10ml perfume oil roll-on ideal for travel or daily carry."," Red cedar, aldehydes, frankincense distillate, cypress root, black pine, cascarilla bark, incense, spanish cade, and birch tar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bowmakers Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga," If you can imagine a workshop, lit by oil lamps and a brace of flickering candles, wax dripping to the floor. Everywhere is wood, maple, mahogany, chips of darkest ebony, floor littered in fragrant curled shavings, the air filled with lacquered dust and the aromatics of a thousand sweet pencils. A man bends over an oak bench, tending to the curved form of a violin, the body warm and golden in the soft light, its neck, pegs and tailpiece scattered under his nimble fingers. Puffs of pine resin drift as he works, smoothing, gluing and attending to the preparation of varnishes and oils to give ornate lustre to grain and line. This is D.S & Durga's Bowmakers, an astonishing time capsule evocation of violin and bow making workshops in 18th century American pioneer towns. Each workshop concocted their own secret recipe for the decorative shellacs and lacquers. These might contain elemi, benzoin, saffron, mastic, sandalwood and turpentine for color, preservation, finish, tone and beauty.  D.S.& Durga have brought this polished, resinous portrait of craftsmen to life in an affecting and vibrantly glowing scent.This Pocket Perfume is a 10ml perfume oil roll-on ideal for travel or daily carry."," Violin varnish, mahogany, outdoors accord, amber pine resin, maplewood, cypress, spiced tree resin, cedar, and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68623.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Debaser Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga," Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent, Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail, the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser, named after the bands 1989 hit, is not a typically creamy, lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright, hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic, warm, bold and woody fig. It's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown, when it shed the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris, coconut, tonka and moss -  leave cool, velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive.This Pocket Perfume is a 10ml perfume oil roll-on ideal for travel or daily carry."," Bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Devil Tender Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," Exhilaratingly liberated, bewitchingly feminine, Devil Tender is a boldly sexy new fragrance from Ex Nihilo. Built around a lush Bulgarian rose, equally fresh and ravishingly rich, Devil Tender takes that feminine beauty and adds a touch of the transgressive, sucking us in with a mouthwateringly forbidden accord of sweet peach juice and tart grapefruit spiked with a subtle but dangerous spice blend. In the layered and complex drydown, smooth suede and robust cedar and sandalwood extend the longevity and power of the scent, delivering gorgeous texture and seductive temptation. Pretty enough to put a smile on your face, yet dark and sexy enough to put impure thoughts into your mind, Devil Tender is another deceptively sophisticated stunner from what is quickly becoming one of our favorite modern French houses."," Pink grapefruit, pink pepper, peach juice accord, rose water, Bulgarian rose, petalia, suede accord, white cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sublimes Essences Musc Perfume Oil,Ex Nihilo," Les Sublimes Essences: a duo of exquisite perfume oils that showcase not only Ex Nihilo's superior ingredients and modern formulations, but also their reverence for perfumery's most venerable traditions- in this case, the distinctly Middle Eastern tradition of layering. The Sublimes Essences oils are designed to layer, purpose-built for combining with Ex Nihilo's delightful and creative Eaux de Parfum, while also presenting ample character and fortitude on their own. In other words, the possibilities are endless.In true Ex Nihilo fashion, Musc is so much more than your run-of-the-mill generic musky oil, purpose-built to combine the solar, sensual and clean aspects of this marvelous note into a cashmere-smooth fragrance oil that brings out untold depths in any fragrance with even a minor musky component. Delicate spice, smooth transparent florals and a combination of dynamic musky notes hum with quiet force. Ex Nihilo recommends using Musc oil to bring out Cologne 352's orange blossom, Rose Hubris' rose, or Oud VendÃ´me's vanilla. All great ideas, but we say don't stop there- with an oil this compellingly gorgeous, there are no limits."," Clove, rose, freesia, orange blossom, serenolid musk, nirvanolid, cosmone, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Soft Tension Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," Hazy and hypnotic, Soft Tension is a floral musk that replicates the anchorless wonder of wandering through a deep and endless white fog. An enchanting musk provides the fog's body, pillow-soft yet entirely substantial, diffusing across the skin in languorous clouds, while peppery freesia and green mate periodically slice through the haze like tendrils of sunlight. A smooth cedar and fresh, lichenous moss beckon from the horizon, reminding us of the world that still surrounds us at the periphery of vision. Haunting and delicate, Soft Tension is a skin scent of mystery and quiet power for those who know that sometimes we must be lost in order to find what we're looking for."," Freesia, musk, mate absolute, cedarwood, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arbole Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," In Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca's famous poem, ArbolÃ©, ArbolÃ©..., a succession of travelers unsuccessfully attempt to sway the affections of a pretty young woman picking olives from a green tree. Just like its namesake poem, Hiram Green's ArbolÃ© is simple and beautiful, deeply evocative and quietly, sumptuously romantic. Based on a deceptively short list of notes, it nonetheless exudes hidden complexity, as earthy, naturalistic patchouli merges with dry, robust cedar and velvety sandalwood to create overlapping tonalities of sweet and smooth, and soft and spicy, that exude the beguiling yet straightforward beauty of Lorca's heroine. As it dries, creamy vanilla and powdery tonka whisk us further into the magically-real dream, where none of the many colorful opportunities that beckon us away from our dry, green tree could be as fulfilling as the life in front of our eyes."," Patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Tragedy of Lord George Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," ""Lord George is a wealthy and respected man, the archetypical patriarch. He seems to emboy the noblest values of the aristocracy- virtue, respect, loyalty and faithfulness."" ...but of course, in the subversive universe of Penhaligon's Portraits, not all is as it seems, and Lord George has secret dalliances that could threaten the reputation of his household. As such, his fragrance is both perfectly, properly British- clean, sophisticated shaving soap and warm, lightly powdery tonka- and, with an intriguing vein of rich, boozy brandy, a bit dangerous as well. The perfect scent for a gentleman with something dark hidden away."," Brandy, shaving soap, tonka bean,",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Revenge of Lady Blanche Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," A darling of London Society, and one of the most influential ladies in Britain. Her aloof beauty, mysterious past and blazing passions are scrutinized by all from shop-girls to Royalty. She would do anything to climb the social ladder still further. Her latest scheme is to poison her husband, Lord George, inheriting his wealth and burying his secrets forever! Her fragrance reflects her very essence: a green floral, beautifully classical with powdery orris, yet harbouring dark designs with heady, narcotic narcissus lingering hypnotically. For any grand dame with ruthless ambitions, Lady Blanche is a devastatingly gorgeous calling card."," Orris, narcissus flower, hyacinth",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Much Ado About the Duke Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Conforming to the expectations of his class, Duke Nelson married the most coveted girl in London: the Duchess Rose. Yet the Duke is eccentric and unusual, his whimsical airs set society tongues wagging. Rumors abound that his marriage is yet to be consumated!His perfume is as ambivalent as he is: a floral yet masculine woody fragrance, flamboyant in spice and gin-laced aromatics, soft with luscious rose, given a masculine lilt with leather and wood. While we may suspect the Duke's secret, his fragrance tells us not to fret on his behalf- his double-life may be double the fun."," Pepper, rose, gin, leather, wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Coveted Duchess Rose Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Daughter of Lady Blanche and Lord George, Rose married a Duke to escape the stifling rigidity of her family and to become the Duchess Rose. At first naively romantic, she has now become disillusioned and frustrated in an unsatisfactory marriage. Always looking for fun and frivolity, and perhaps an illicit affair, her fragrance is a not so innocent fresh rose, resplendent with rich and juicy orange, seductively musky, and, in the long and lovely drydown, surprisingly woodsy. The Duchess Rose may not play by the rules, but if you let yourself into her embrace, you're bound to be seduced."," Mandarin orange, rose, musk, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Into The Void Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Outer space- simultaneously bright and pitch black, weightless but infinitely dense, free from all physical forces and laws. This is the scent of Into The Void, Juliette Has a Gun's most radical and unique fragrance yet from the always surprising Luxe collection. In Romano Ricci's take on the infinite unknowable that is space, dark and light intertwine, delivering a warm yet lightweight combination of dry woodsiness and curious intensity. A distinct licorice note arrests our attention from the beginning, leaving us open for the alien tones of orchid touched with powdery, papyrus-laced tonka bean. Animalic, ambery wood notes meld with a patchouli so sharp it's almost two dimensional, and the overall effect is haunting, deep but delicate, and utterly original. Take a step into the unknown with Into The Void- a fragrance for the bravest and boldest that represents a giant leap for Juliette Has a Gun."," Licorice, orchid, tonka, papyrus, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, ambroxan, norlimbanol",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40128.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait,Tauer Perfumes," If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L'Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.Au Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L'Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L'Air's smoke. Those who love L'Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31434.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sheiduna Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," Shei-du-na. Enunciate each syllable and all the right associations come to mind: she, sheikh, dunes. In his 1992 novel The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje mentions that sand dunes in the Sahara resemble the dips and hollows of a woman's back. Sheiduna perfectly captures that sense of duality between two things that look the same and yet are not the same – the shadowed softness of a woman's hip and the dusty angularity of a wind-sharpened dune. The opening is a plume of smoke and tangerine peel set inside a golden, radiant cloud of resins that swirls around the wearer like a sand storm. Out of this expansive blur of sparkling particles emerges a spicy clove note that gives the fragrance a subtle vintage Opium hue. A rich rose weaves in and out of this fuzzy haze of amber and spices, like the orange-red glow of lighthouse in thick fog. It's this seamless shifting between dry, spicy radiance and soft, sweet florals and vanilla that makes Sheiduna so interesting – and so difficult to define. We'd sum it up by saying it's like breathing in the arid air of the desert while nuzzling the neck of an exotically perfumed woman."," Lemon, tangerine, blackcurrant, aldehydes, Bulgarian rose essence, geranium, clove, vetiver, patchouly, woody amber, incense, benzoin, myrrh, tonka bean, vanilla pods, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Graphite Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Left alone, the tools of creation- pencil, paper, chalk- take on a creativity of their own, a symphony of grays and whites with surprising depth and compelling uniqueness. Smoky graphite, smooth chalk and crisp, clean wood combine to evoke and inspire, resulting in a scent that wears on the skin like a modern, evocative and unexpectedly sensual composition. A fragrance for the doodler, the dreamer, the academic, and the forever young."," Monochrome graphite, chalk palette, cropped wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75213.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Uddu Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Inspired by the sensual beauty of primitive artifacts, Black Uddu is an intense, leathery floral that thrums with ancient energy. Resting on a base of polished, faceted amber, the fragrance is smoky, powerful, complex yet raw, richly balsamic and primally compelling. Like the cubist masks it draws upon, we may not be able to understand all of its secrets- but that only draws us further in."," Resins, leather, violet, musk, woody notes, amber, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75214.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Covent Garden Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," Covent Garden- an iconic section of central London, known for historic theatre and opera venues, classic architecture, and the fruit and vegetable market made world famous in My Fair Lady. It's a district of bustle and commerce, high culture and history, and Richard E. Grant sets out to capture it all in Covent Garden the fragrance, an exuberant and sparkling unisex citrus floral rich with the smells and energy of one of London's most vibrant locales. Covent Garden opens with crisp, buzzing notes of orange, lime and ginger, an energized portrait of a market in full swing. As distinctive florals and spices emerge in the heart, the tableau pans backwards, revealing the elegance that frames the action. Finally, striking and unique notes of carrot and buttery orris radiate sophistication and depth, connecting the ancient to the modern and every dynamic era in between. Jack Perfume's fragrances truly are love letters to London, and with Covent Garden, the full, delightful spectrum of what there is to love in this spectacular city is on full display."," Orange, lime, ginger, pink peppercorns, rose, pimento, carrot, orris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Musc Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," Vermillion- the brilliant red pigment made from the mineral cinnabar, a pigment essential to the art and decor of Ancient Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and ancient India and China. Red Musc- vermillion in scent form, a brilliant and incandescent musk with subtle intensity and poise. Glowing embers and a light booziness cradle the musk in an intense but controlled flame, hovering off of the skin, seductive and purposeful. A skin scent for someone who doesn't believe in skin scents.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75211.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terre Noire Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len," All of Europe's great mysteries lie in her forests, ancient as the continent itself, unknowable and full of magic...both light and dark. Terre Noire pays tribute to this great continental legacy with a rich and evocative elemental bouquet of bark, earth and wood, striking a cold and compelling atmosphere both haunting and naturalistically comforting. A pulsing vein of spice laces through the fragrance, harnessing the natural energy of the scent and preventing things from becoming too dark or relaxed. The total effect is magical- a perfect scent for dreamers, adventurers, and all travelers along the outskirts of the world we know."," Soil tincture, spicy notes, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75212.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Picadilly '69 Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," On his first-ever trip to London in 1969, a 12-year old Richard E. Grant was mesmerized by the colorful characters of Picadilly Circus- not to mention the intoxicating scents of the busy social hub- the petrol, the leather, the Earl Grey tea, and of course, the patchouli oil worn so ubiquitously by mods, hippies and youth of all stripes. Picadilly '69 is a faithful ode to this scent memory, a visceral rush of spicy, earthy, stimulating and narcotic, a perfect representation of the extremely specific time and place, but also the universal experience of a teenager taking their first hesitant steps into the desires and appeals of the adult world. Picadilly '69 opens crisp and fresh, with bergamot (representing the Earl Grey at Fortnum and Mason) and ginger giving an invigorating initial rush against the green notes wafting over from nearby St. James' Park. The energetic cityscape is well-represented in the heart,  with hypnotic notes of cypriol and petrol, while the rich leather drydown is sensuous and provocative. Whether you fondly remember the Summer of Love, or merely want a taste of a historic, yet personal, awakening, Picadilly '69 will take you to a time and place where anything was possible."," Bergamot, ginger, green leaves, cypriol, mate, petrol, cedar, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jack Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume," Richard E. Grant has long been a star of stage and screen, bringing life to dynamic characters in revered films and shows including Downton Abbey, Withnail & I, and Doctor Who. But his lifelong obsession has never been the dramatic, but rather, the olfactory. And we're delighted to report that his flagship scent, Jack Eau de Parfum, is no mere celebuscent, but rather, a revelation-  an addictive combination of earthy and citrus notes that's as striking and attention-getting as it is deeply, hypnotically enjoyable. Opening with a distinct and edgy burst of tart lime and herbaceous marijuana, a spicy bouquet in the heart quickly delivers on Jack EDP's promise to deliver ""a hypnotic fragrance to be savoured by both men and women."" Rich woods, tobacco, incense and musk assert themselves powerfully but casually, making Jack a perfect everyday fragrance, as at home over jeans and a t-shirt as it would be striking with formalwear. Distinct, provocative, comfortable, and quintessentially British, Jack is an example of that wondrous and all-too-rare scent that just plain smells great."," Lime, mandarin, clove, pepper, nutmeg, oud, vetiver, white musk, marijuana accord, tobacco absolute, olibanum resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Sacree Extrait de Parfum,HEELEY," Since ancient days, disparate societies separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years have all nevertheless used incense as a centerpiece of their spiritual practices, and it's certainly no mystery why- with its delicate, ethereal nature, incense seems like a crucial connection point between our world and a higher plane of existence where the tangible and the metaphysical intertwine. With Eau SacrÃ©e, James Heeley invites us through that veil, into a world of soft but intensely powerful smokes and resins meant to purify the soul, free the mind from earthly matters and lift the spirit to a higher state of being. Eau SacrÃ©e is a potent, yet understated fragrance that expertly combines resinous labdanum, subtle spice, and warm, sweet myrhh around a divine and exquisite olibanum incense both soft and rich, smoky and transparent, and utterly exceptional. Glowing with serenity and enlightenment, Eau SacrÃ©e is an incense scent with higher purpose, which simply must be experienced to be understood."," Aldehydes, clove, nutmeg, pepper, incense, amber, cedar, musk, opoponax, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31525.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arabian Horse Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Picture yourself astride a majestic purebred stallion, galloping through a dewey morning in the untouched countryside of the English moor. Imagine the feeling of unbridled exhilaration, the speed of the wind that whips across your body, the visceral impact of hooves against the damp green earth, the smell of wildflowers mixed with the animalic heft of the horse's mane, the heat that radiates from its body. This is the scene so masterfully painted by Arabian Horse, a fragrance of such evocative power that it literally took our breath away.The key to Arabian Horse's extraordinary impact is the incredible amount of precious materials used, a new record in complexity and expense for Parfumerie Generale. Narcissus absolute sings with powerful, heady floral character, while highest-quality labdanum absolute and cypriol coeur inflect the base notes with deep, perfectly balanced oriental hues. But the beating heart of the scent is a stirringly animalic ballet of musks, leather and a ""horse's mane"" accord of compelling realism. It's a gorgeous, gigantic fragrance, but so balanced and specific that it never overwhelms- it merely thrills. Lovers of complex leathers, fierce animalics, or simply those who appreciate artistry unencumbered by commercial consideration- don't miss this olfactive masterwork from Pierre Guillaume."," Green notes, wildflowers, narcissus, musk, cypriol, woods, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34551.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Andalou Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Andalusia, the romantic southern tip of Spain, where Europe meets Africa. A region known for its ancient walled cities, Moorish arches, and famous leather workshops tucked away on dusty, cobblestone streets. Like the eclectic, vibrant region for which it is named, Cuir Andalou is balanced to perfection. Its warm, rich leather mingles with the cool darkness of oud. Smoke and dusty saffron waft through a floral heart of neroli, rose, violet and iris. Vetiver and castoreum leave a powdery, earthy dry-down. This is one of the most potent, interesting, and surprising leathers we've come across in a long time. We can't stop sniffing."," Leather, Patchouli, Saffron, Neroli, rose, Violet, iris, Castoreum, Vetiver, Sandalwood & Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1962 Eau de Parfum,Floris London," 1962 Eau de Parfum is a fragrance of unbridled affection to an era of love, modernism and evolution. In the summer of 1962, music, art and colour had lifed Soho into a world of its own, where coffee bars and rock clubs held court. Visiting London for the first time in 1962, the smells of spices, herbs and fruits welcomed your arrival into the city's bohemian quarter.Vibrant notes of effervescent bergamot and zesty green mandarin with herbal hints of basil, spearmint and spice lead to a warm, powerful heart of cypress and jasmine. Base notes of cedarwood, moss and musk with amber create longevity and a woody undertone, which develops early and sustains the fragrance."," Green mandarin, clove, spearmint, bergamot, cypress, basil, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedarwood, moss, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1976 Eau de Parfum,Floris London," 1976 Eau de Parfum is a fragrance of juxtaposition in an era of light and shade.

Mmmm... Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," In the words of Romano Ricci, MMMM... is“a forbidden fruit.” We say that if you've ever wanted to smell as sparkly and as desirable as those ruby slippers that Dorothy wore in The Wizard of Oz, then move a little closer please. MMMM... just uttering its name forces a little moan of pleasure to escape your mouth. Yes, it's a little embarrassing. You're a grown woman. But it is difficult to resist something so straight-forwardly delicious. This fragrance is nothing more than a vanilla cream puff infused with orange-scented neroli and dotted with raspberries. Flirty white florals, sandalwood, and patchouli add a touch of seriousness, but not much. Go on, gorge yourself silly while swinging your red ruby slippers back and forth. We're in no position to judge."," Neroli, raspberry, geranium, orange flower, jasmine sambac, tuberose, iris, patchouli, sandalwood, salicilates",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40127.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Russian Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," Russian Leather conjures up a picture of an army marching through the dark, snow-covered pine forests of the freezing tundra. These boys are made of tough material, and so are their boots. Green, smoky, and aromatic, the leather accord is tough and satisfying. A fougere accord of pine, ferns, cedar, mint, lavender and coumarin brings the forest into focus, filling your lungs with the scent of pine needles trampled underfoot and the bite of the cold, Northern night air. The smell of gaiac wood being burned in a far off campfire snakes through the forest and mingles with the dark, oily smoke of the men's black leather boots. A challenging, deeply evocative fragrance, this will unsettle everyone but men with adventure-seeking souls."," Basil, pine tree, rosemary, clary sage, fern, lavender, cedar needles, coriander, mint, patchouli, guaiac, cypress, tonka bean, nutmeg, Russian leather accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Incense Oud Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Not all oud is created equal. Some is cut with screechy, headache inducing synthetics, while others are harvested unethically, contributing to a potential future where this precious resource will be lost to the ravages of human consumption. But with Incense Oud, Mme. Patricia de NicolaÃ¯ has yet again delivered an exquisite oud fragrance of the highest order, rich with the deep, resinous and evocative aroma of sustainably harvested Cambodian agarwood, here paired against a divinely ethereal incense from the Kingdom of Oman, resulting in a compelling scent with powerful oud presence but a uniquely artistic complexity. From the start, Incense Oud radiates individuality with a bright, fresh, herbaceous opening of artemisia and coriander, soon revealing a sweet liquor note paired with a woodsy, intricate chord of dark oud, stout cedarwood and earthy patchouli. A resinous, animalic base including castoreum and leather lends dimensionality to the incense, imbuing the sensual into the spiritual. Tenacious, exotic, unique and long lasting, Incense Oud is another one of a kind creation from Parfums de NicolaÃ¯- a treasure that, thanks to their admirable sourcing practices, can be enjoyed by generations to come."," Artemisia, davana, ambrette, oud, coriander, cypriol, cedar, rose, patchouli, castoreum, amber, styrax, musk, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31355.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lilac Love Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Disclaimer: this is not a lilac perfume. This is a lilac-colored angora sweater that you want to wear on your naked skin while rolling around on 1,000-thread count sheets with a basket of gray Persian kittens. It is a million miles away from the bold oriental regalia of the Amouage lineage – this one whispers, and has an adorable French accent. We can't get over how pretty Lilac Love is. A soft bouquet of roses, jasmine, gardenia, and heliotrope is whipped up into a rosy, milky froth, dusted liberally with cocoa powder, tonka bean shavings, and fresh vanilla sugar. The texture transitions fluently between a cool, floral milk (lactones, gardenia) to a warm, cocoa-like powder (iris, patchouli). You won't know whether to wear it or sip it from a mug while watching the snow fall outside your ski lodge."," Jasmine, rose, gardenia, peony, heliotrope, orris, cacao, tonka bean, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41869.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Barbier de Tanger Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," If you have ever bemoaned the fact that old-school barbershop fougeres have gone the way of dinosaurs, then, ahem, may we introduce you to Le Barbier de Tanger? Soap, pine, lavender, moss....one can almost feel the scrape of the barber's blade against our cheek and hear the snap as he pulls his leather strap taut. Close your eyes and slip into the comfort of a genteel environment, evoking memories of your father and his morning grooming rituals. Wearing Le Barbier de Tanger is like stepping into the bathroom after him, smelling gorgeously of hot soapy water, clean leather, and aromatics so sharp that they slap you awake. The bone structure of a proper fougere is all there – oakmoss, coumarin, and lavender. But the story doesn't stop there. A surprisingly touch of apple and pineapple adds a clean, sporty freshness, and ambroxan adds a haunting ambergris note complete with its silvery driftwood feel. Clean, spicy, mossy, and charmingly direct, we would be surprised if this fragrance wasn't an immediate hit with wet shavers and lovers of retro masculines."," Basil, cardamom, lemon, bergamot, yellow tangerine, lavender, petitgrain, galbanum, pineapple, apple, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, ambery wood notes, ambroxan, oak moss notes, coumarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36521.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Ambre Loup Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," We know what you're thinking. Amber - been there, done that, got the t-shirt, yadda yadda. Well, we're here to tell you that Ambre Loup is different and that you need it. Because this wild thing with a tarry, smoky twist is the amber that touches the primal part of your hunter-gatherer soul that other ambers failed to reach. Ambre Loup opens up on a smoky, animalic castoreum note that comes off partly like oud oil and partly like warm, chewy tar. Peru balsam is responsible for a thick, cinnamon-spiced resinousness, but labdanum is real the star of the show here, displaying every nuance of its rich, smoky, tobacco-like character. Under the dry, rugged woods and resins, a slow-moving river of golden vanilla and tonka swells up and fills the scent with a sweet, creamy sensuousness. Quite simply, a amber that is too beautiful, unique, and unusual to pass up."," Clove, spices, Balsam Peru, Labdanum, Vanilla,  Agarwood, Gaiac, Cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin Kama Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Jasmin Kama is an excellent showcase for Egyptian jasmine, which is richly animalic, slightly coarse, and fruity. The word Kama brings to mind thoughts of the Kama Sutra, and why yes, this is one seriously carnal scent!A brilliant bergamot opens the show with a sour, bright citrus accent that fizzes violently enough to get your saliva glands working. A clutch of Egyptian jasmine blooms immediately begin to pump out a stream of inky, fecund indoles into the air, reminding the wearer that the aroma of jasmine is excitingly close to the smell of decay, sex, and rebirth. Heliotrope adds a powdery sparkle that balances out the inky, fruity jasmine, but earthy patchouli in the base drags jasmine further into the shadows. Simultaneously fresh and indolic, Jasmin Kama is a jasmine for those searching for a different take on this most sultry of white flowers."," Bergamot, Rosa Damascena, Jasmin (Jasmin Absolute, Egypt), Patchouli, Sandalwood, Heliotrope, Vanilla, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
T. Habanero Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," T. Habanero stuns with its unique portrayal of what happens when a fruity, stinky Cambodi oud meets a dark, nutty tobacco leaf. Imagine a thick stew of chocolatey spices fermenting in an oak barrel, and a man pouring in handfuls of dry tobacco leaves and oud wood chips, dark with resin. After a long soak, the drenched woods and tobacco leaves are spread out to bake under a hot sun, releasing a host of fruited, dark, fermented aromas. One doesn't know where the oud begins and the tobacco ends.The genius of this scent is that the perfumer knows how to pull all the chaotic, disparate elements of the scent into one harmonious whole, using a smooth, earthy myrrh to link the fungal dampness of the oud to the creamy sweetness of the tobacco leaf. What could have easily been a rough cacophony turns out to be a suave and sophisticated tobacco fragrance. A real tour de force."," Pink pepper, black pepper, cardamom, black tobacco, sandalwood, agarwood, incense, myrrh, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavande 44 Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," If you think you smelled every possible variation on the lavender theme, then think again. Rania J.'s Lavande 44 is a wholly unique take on the genre, mixing one part aromatics (green, fresh lavender bud) with one part animalics (oud, musk) and two parts resinous oriental (labdanum, tonka, patchouli). The result is stunning. A cube of sour citrus and aromatic lavender up top melts down through the fragrance structure, pooling in and around buttery tonka and providing little sparks of electric freshness to the dark, animalic oud. Vetiver root in the base joins with the lavender and patchouli to form a damp, salty breeze that makes one think of the humid air in a pine forest. A thoroughly modern way to wear lavender, Lavande 44 dispels all thoughts of shaving soap and sachets for the linen drawer."," Bergamot, Petitgrain, Lavender (Essential Oil and Absolute), Agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Assam Eau de Parfum,Rania J.," Oud virgins, look away now – Rania J.'s majestic Oud Assam features an authentic Indian oud oil that doesn't pull any punches. The juicy, bitter orange framing the opening notes only serves to highlight the creamy bleu cheese feel of the oud. But give it a moment to settle, and you'll begin to understand why Indian oud is considered the most spiritually uplifting type of oud. As the nose adjusts and the oud note begins to soften, one begins to discern the complex aromas of deep golden spice, leather, and fermented, creamy woodiness. A smell as ancient as time itself.Better yet, this is one Western oud that doesn't drift into aimless sweetness in the base. Instead, a nutty vetiver, peppery musk, and smoky incense contributes a fresh, woodsy character that makes one think of a great forest in a Northern clime. A genuine oud experience in this price bracket is a rarity – we recommend you take the leap."," Bergamot, Sweet Orange, Bitter Orange, Oud from India, Cedar, Vetiver, Frankincense, Black pepper, Tonka bean, Musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Larmes du Desert Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Alive with exotic mysticism, Larmes du DÃ©sert is a smoky, spicy amber that glows like the warmth left infused in the desert sands well after the sun has gone down for the night. A smooth, captivating incense leads us through the swirling dunes into a world of seductive dry woods, rich patchouli, and the ethereal allure of golden amber and myrrh, possessed of divine potency and disarming pleasures. Noble, magical and beautiful, Larmes du DÃ©sert is a stunning new offering for women and men alike."," Incense, cypress, patchouli, gaiac, cedar, citrus, amber, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lune Feline Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," There's nothing more alluring than defying expectations, and that's exactly what Lune FÃ©line does with exotic flair. Too sweet and creamy for an oriental, too smoky and balsamic for a gourmand, Lune FÃ©line is a genuinely delightful fulcrum between the styles- the kind of unexpectedly perfect balance that will make you delightedly return to your wrist again and again as you try to unravel its secrets. Lune FÃ©line instantly opens with elements of both oriental and gourmand, as rich, fiery cinnamon and savory cardamom ignite the senses with passion. A smooth, woodsy heart plays off the smoky, animalic growl of styrax and high quality ambergris, while the creamy vanilla melds with rich balsam for a seductively mouthwatering combination with a decidedly edgy sophistication. Forget categorization; with a scent this delectably sensual, there's nothing to do but give yourself over to its dark and luxurious symphony."," Cinnamon, cardamom, pink pepper, green notes, cedar, ambergris, woods, styrax, vanilla, peru balsam, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Omeyyade Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors," Bewitching, beautiful, and a touch too beguiling to be completely safe, Rose Omeyyade is the very definition of a secret weapon. Named for the Umayyad dynasty, whose kingdom once stretched from Westernmost Europe to the Middle East, Rose Omeyyade is as expansive and cultured as its namesake- a truly extraordinary floral. Rose Omeyyade opens with a burst of delectable florals, rich Damask Rose paired with fruity raspberry and energized with pink pepper. A heart of caramelized patchouli and rich gaiac furthers the east-meets-west motif with mouthwatering potency, which only deepens in the warm, soft and subtly animalic base of oud and amber. With its immediate floral appeal and dark, seductive twists, Rose Omeyyade is the kind of floral that makes heads turn- and then turn again."," Raspberry, rose, pink pepper, patchouli, gaiac, brown sugar, amber, sandalwood, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bapteme du Feu Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," A proper carnival is full of light, noise, laughter, activity- and, ideally, that exhilarating sense of chaos that makes the world feel topsy-turvy and just the right amount of dangerous. Inspired by the funfairs of Serge Lutens' youth, Bapteme du Feu is a stroll through a gleefully disorienting boardwalk featuring the wonderfully discordant notes of sweet delights, animalic musk and the acerbic gunpowder of the carnival shooting range. As in previous Lutens creations, his favorite childhood treat of gingerbread plays a central role, but unlike the soft creaminess of Five O'Clock au Gingembre, the sweet ginger here is offset with the bitterness of burnt orange peel and galvanized with the striking, metallic tang of gunpowder. We suppose you could call it an avant-garde gourmand, but that somehow doesn't seem to encompass it fully. Perhaps the best we can say is that it is, as all of Serge Lutens' best works are, a portal into the unique world and vision of one of perfumery's truly independent voices."," Burnt orange peel, gunpowder, gingerbread, fresh ginger, cedar, incense, cinnamon, osmanthus, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36155.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Green Pearl Eau de Parfum,Thameen," In China, few objects are more revered, more coveted, more legandary than the Yemengzhu, luminescent minerals known to give unlimited luck and power to those few lucky enough to merely touch them. As lush and radiant as the otherworldly green glow of those treasured objects, Green Pearl is a wondrous addition to the Thameen line.  Crisp, bracing notes of green apple and glowing citrus open into a bracingly green heart of artemisia and green tea that soothe even while radiating power. And just as Yemengzhu glow deep underground with no external light source, a base of rich tonka, oakmoss, and amber-tinged musk give off a humming glow that lasts for untold hours. The Yemengzhu are so unique among the many minerals of our planet that geologists still can't rule out mystical explanations as to their origin; with its undeniable and captivating quiet power, Green Pearl is a perfect representation in the world of fragrance."," Green apple, mandarin, neroli, bergamot, green tea, artemisia, tonka, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," A Rolls Royce in a sea of Volkswagens, Roja Dove's Amber Aoud sets out to best every other rose-oud out there by sheer dint of superior raw materials and blending. Expensive this may be, but Roja Dove puts his money where his mouth is. Taking a regally sour, spicy Indian oud, he buries it deep within the folds of a jammy rose, and then tucks the whole thing into the pulpy insides of a Moroccan fig. Almost obscenely rich and opulent at first, it wears like the inside of a red velvet cloak lined in ermine. But look closely and you will see the artful balance between sweet and sour, dusty and moist, sharp and smooth. There is structure and discipline within the avalanche of richness. Birch tar and incense resins and gums provide a smoky fade-out that proves to be excellent ballast for the jammy sweetness up top. No wonder that many oud aficionados cite this as the best example of Western oud perfumery- a point we'd find hard to dispute."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, fig, jasmine, rose, ylang ylang, ambergris, aoud wood, birch, cinnamon, civet, musk, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74812.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Imagine a courtly banquet hall, its walls hung with massive velvet tapestries, Irish wolfhounds lounging in fireplaces, heavy winter fur cloaks and sleeping animals strewn all around the stone floor. The High Priest lights his censer in a lull of conversation, and walks slowly through the hall, allowing thick plumes of smoke from fragrant incense resins and bitter dried herbs to circulate. Traders have brought a rare treasure for the King to look at – tiny shards of what they call oud wood. He burns a piece, and the air is suddenly pierced with a majestic aroma that comprises sour woodiness, smoke, rot, and a forest floor. This is what Musk Aoud smells like. All of this, all at once.Roja Dove's Musk Aoud is deeply, carnally suggestive. The musk is warm and suggestive of both animal and human fur. But what really rocks our boat is the current of smoky, oily sweetness running though the fragrance. The tensile weight here suggests centuries of smells packed in one on top of another, finally merging into one suggestive whole. We find it incredibly sexy. In fact, if we arrive at a bacchanalia and this scent isn't being pumped through the air ducts, then we're leaving."," Bergamot, lemon, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, ambrette, birch, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, precious woods, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74813.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Diaghilev Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Mitsouko reupholstered in more expensive fabrics? Since it is named for Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes and someone who drenched the curtains in his bedroom and theatres with Mitsouko, it's tempting to think so. Insanely rich and opulent, Diaghilev takes the three pillars of the chypre – oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin – and wraps them up in a length of the dusty red velvet curtain that's been hanging in the OpÃ©ra National de Paris for over a century.But that's only part of the story. After all, who would pay such a high price for a remake of Mitsouko? Diaghilev stands head and shoulders above all other chypres for two reasons. First, the quality of the raw materials – think the smoothest oakmoss, the inkiest vetiver, the most exquisite ambrette seed, and finest floral absolutes – makes for an experience so intoxicating that you just stop questioning the cost. Second, Roja Dove has flushed the perfume with sensual musks, civet, resins, overripe fruit, and castoreum, loosening the stays on that uptight chypre structure and making it impossible to wear without thinking about sex. Bitter, rich, and complex, Diaghilev is the scent of old books, musty theatres, velvet curtains soaked in Mitsouko, and the sheen of salty, lickable, post-coital sweat on your lover's skin. Put smelling Diaghilev on your bucket list."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, orange, tarragon, blackcurrant buds, heliotrope, jasmine, peach, rose, tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, ambrette, benzoin, cedarwood, civet, clove, cumin, guaiacwood, labdanum, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, patchouli, peru balsam, sandalwood, styrax, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nuwa Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums," Named for an ancient Chinese goddess known for creating mankind and repairing the pillars of heaven, and described by Roja Dove as“The Elixir of the Gods”, it would seem that NÃ¼wa has a lot to live up to. Famously reformulated in 2015 to banish a heavy, animalistic cumin note, NÃ¼wa is now reborn as a floral oriental with a delicate transparency that jives better with its Chinese inspiration. It is simply exquisite. Now a gently-spiced floral with a peachy osmanthus heart and a backdrop of smoky black tea, NÃ¼wa is a fragrance to wear while strolling down the Riverside Promenade in Shanghai, slowly twirling a stiff silk umbrella over your head. Smoky resins and spice add exoticism, but never obscure the golden florals. Later on, a dusky jasmine accord moves in, and the effect is like walking under a pagoda dripping with jasmine vines at night, their warm, spicy scent snaking out into the warm air around you. If rose gold had a scent, it would be this."," Bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant buds, immortelle, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang ylang ambergris, birch, black pepper, cistus, clove, cumin, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, storax, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Mythique Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," What makes a perfect amber? Some might say it's a perfectly smooth, balsamic texture; others might favor an exotic, attention getting heart. In the case of amber experts MaÃ®tre Parfumeur's newest entry, Ambre Mythique, we're lucky enough to get both, and as we can attest, it's truly magical. Built around MPG's renowned central amber accord of exquisite vanilla, labdanum and tonka, Ambre Mythique adds a touch of magical flair with rich notes of incense and myrrh, meant to evoke the mysticism of the shifting sands of the Omani desert at dusk. The result is an amber both comforting and fascinating, where silky smoothness meets entrancing smokiness, sweet enough to entice and mysterious enough to seduce. It's safe to say that the unquestioned masters of the amber fragrance still have a trick or two up their sleeves."," Bergamot, geranium, coriander, incense, myrrh, labdanum, lavender, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29318.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Zagora Eau de Toilette,The Different Company," Vibrantly fresh, dynamically fruity, White Zagora is a zesty bolt of peach-infused sunshine from The Different Company's L'Espirit collection. Described as a ""sensual oriental"" fragrance, White Zagora certainly packs enough spicy floral and amber punch to meet the strict definition, but check your expectations of heaviness at the door- this is the oriental as ethereal, as bright, crisp and easy-to-wear as any fruity-floral we've ever smelled. White Zagora begins with an eye-opening zing of bergamot and citron, quickly smoothed out with a blissful heart of white florals and succulent peach blossom. Creamy osmanthus adds mouthwatering depth, while delicate, surprisingly cool amber and clean white musk keep the fruity floral tones alive for hours. Some fragrances overwhelm with layers within layers of complexity and challenge, while others stun with a simple ability to smell incredible without ever seeming dumbed down or commercial. White Zagora, with its wonderfully straightforward irresponsibility, is just that- simply marvelous."," Neroli, citron, bergamot, orange blossom, peach blossom, tuberose, osmanthus, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25341.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
New Sibet Extrait de Parfum,Slumberhouse," Slumberhouse has built their mythic reputation on unpredictability; Josh Lobb's scents are unencumbered by the restrictions of the fragrance intelligentsia. So while the name and notes list of New Sibet might indicate a pungently animalic bomb of a scent, don't jump to conclusions. Spray it on your skin and allow yourself to get lost wandering the root-lined hallways of an ancient library long since overtaken by nature; smell the hazy glow of leather-bound tomes written in long-dead languages, the dust dancing in the sunlight that peeks through the vine-choked windows. The animalic notes are here as promised, but rather than growling with vitality, they hum with mature contentment, rich and understated, curled on the soft moss that coats the ground. No, New Sibet doesn't have the dazzling primary colors or rich syrupiness that's characterized so many of the past releases. Instead, in its evocative ability to weave a tale steeped in imagination and sumptuous fantasy, it is undeniably a Slumberhouse."," Carnation, mint, ash, leather, iris, cistus, fur accord, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blueberry Musk Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," Refreshing, delightful and unexpectedly sensual, Blueberry Musk is another wonderful example of Shay & Blue's ability to take the straightforward and make it extraordinary. Unfolding with intriguing complexity, Blueberry musk takes a juicy, uplifting blueberry note and transforms it with rich layers of fruit, musk and woods for a rich, indulgent treat we can't get enough of. Opening right away with that lovely blueberry supplemented with sparkling orange zest, the heart of the scent quickly adds a floral sensuality with creamy magnolia and warm orange blossom. In the dry down, a toe-curlingly smooth blend of white musk and cashmere woods add refinement and longevity. Casual enough for everyday wear, sophisticated enough to add a touch of excitement to any formal occasion, Blueberry Musk is another joyous scent from Shay & Blue."," Blueberry, orange, orange blossom. magnolia, musk, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70415.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grand Soir Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Dress in your finest attire and polish your look. Wander in a never-ending night and enjoy the daring radiance of a magnificent Parisian evening, over and over again. Bridges and monuments shine like a thousand stars, standing majestic in a twilit sky carried away by the soft vanilla warmth of benzoin from Siam and a tonka bean from Brazil that has been jostled by the deep darkness of cistus labdanum from Spain. Warm and charming, yet lithe and sophisticated, Grand Soir is a thrilling night out in the City of Lights."," Labdanum, benzoin, tonka bean, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49854.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Bleu Gris Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," An undisputed classic, Iris Bleu Gris has been known for decades as the reference masculine iris fragrance. Powdery, rooty, earthy and lightly bitter, iris absolute generally finds its natural fit at the center of bombshell feminine floral orientals, but MPG maestro Jean-Paul Millet Page resolved to pair the idiosyncratic flower with the sweetness of citrus fruit, deploying a refreshing cocktail of lemon and bergamot to massage the bitter extremities of the iris into something rounded and bright. This allows the heart of the flower to shine, its powdery earthiness recontextualized into a cleaner, more classically fresh masculine strength. With a mossy vanillic base supplemented with rooty vetiver, disparate and spicy notes are made magically smooth, clean and timelessly stylish."," Green leaves, lemon, bergamot, iris, vanilla, jasmine, musk, vetiver, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29319.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Petit Matin Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Rise at dawn and escape into the delightful freshness of an early morning in Paris to rediscover a taste for beauty. Stroll through the empty streets and archways of a Paris still cast in the first light of day, before taking a rest. Let yourself be carried away by the luminous energy of litsea cubeba from Indonesia, lemon from Calabria, the floral softness of hawthorn and lavandin from Provence. Then, get lost in a labyrinth of musky and ambery notes. Not all who wander are lost, and for those of you who love the thrill of exploration above all else, Petit Matin is your perfect companion."," Cubeb pepper, lemon, lavandin, orange blossom, hawthorne, musk, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49853.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noble VII Cosmos Flower Extrait de Parfum,Clive Christian," Beautifully feminine, universally complex, Noble VII Cosmos Flower is a bold new offering from Clive Christian, the venerable house's very first gourmand fragrance. Inspired by the nobility of England's Queen Anne period and the wondrous gardens that graced the homes of royals and elites, Cosmos Flower is built around the titular flowers' sumptuously rich and mouthwatering chocolatey scent. A delicious blend of sweet benzoin and caramel in the base is given a chypre-like twise with bitter cocoa, dry amber and a hidden touch of leather that unfurls as the fragrance warms. The bouquet at the heart wraps around a deep and fruity rich plum accord that fuses with the intensity of ylang-ylang, the sensuality of jasmine, the fruitiness of osmanthus and the cosmos flower itself. True, natural cocoa delivers both creamy gourmand notes but also a dark bitter edge, enhancing the fruity character detectable in the opening, while a touch of fiery rum brings warmth and delight. Extraordinarily sophisticated, unapologetically British, this gorgeous gourmand represents both a bold new step and also the continuation of the grand tradition of Clive Christian."," Rum, mandarin, pink pepper, apple, jasmine, osmanthus, ylang-ylang, violet, plum, cocoa, benzoin, leather, amber, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Issara Extrait de Parfum,Dusita," As one of modern perfumery's oldest and most stalwart genres, the fougÃ¨re might seem immune to reinvention- what hasn't yet been done? At least, that's how we thought before we smelled Issara. At once fiercely natural and intricately refined, Issara is a fougÃ¨re beyond comparison, blending classic freshness with dynamic ingredients that add unprecedented smoothness and character. Issara immediately identifies itself as a different kind of sun-kissed fougÃ¨re with an opening bright with crisp pine needles, blending effortlessly into a subtle, herbal sage. The sense of natural space only continues in the heart, as an arresting coumarin accord delivers the fresh scent of newly-mown hay, while vetiver and tobacco deliver smoothly spicy aromatic and balsamic tones. In the base, earthy musk and oakmoss hew to traditionally invigorating roots, with another wondrous twist- a rich dose of real ambergris, smooth, lightly spicy, and deeply indulgent. Both natural-feeling and immaculately crafted, smooth and rich, Issara is a new masterpiece of the fougÃ¨re style."," Pine, sage, coumarin, bourbon vetiver, tobacco, musk, amber, oakmoss, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Melodie de l'Amour Extrait de Parfum,Dusita," A floral bouquet of overwhelming beauty, Melodie de l'Amour is another stunning example of Dusita creator Pissara Umavijani's impressive ability to make old concepts feel new again. Featuring one of the most arresting, gorgeous gardenia notes ever captured and supplemented with a delightful blend of over 150 varieties of wild white flowers, it is a truly unique scent that floral lovers should take care not to miss. Melodie de l'Amour opens with the aforementioned gardenia, a stunningly fresh, creamy and lightly spicy note that is perhaps the closest a fragrance has ever come to capturing the natural sophistication and beauty of fresh gardenia flowers. A wondrously creamy and narcotic tuberose flitters in, as well as the freshness of the wild flowers, dipped in romantically sweet honey. In the heart, a gently fruity peach plays amongst even more fresh, natural flowers- sweet Italian broom flower, rich, carnal jasmine and soft, sensual lily of the valley. A delicate base of soothing cedar oil and musk cradles the florals, prolonging the romance without ever supplanting the beautiful bouquet that's the clear star of the show. Sweepingly gorgeous, yet soft enough to wear any day, in any situation, Melodie de l'Amour is one of the best florals we've experienced in quite some time."," Gardenia, tuberose, honey, peach, broom, lily of the valley, jasmine, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oudh Infini Extrait de Parfum,Dusita," If we sound like we're repeating ourselves with our unadulterated praise for each of Parfums Dusita's gorgeous, creative, and utterly luxurious fragrances, it's because we're genuinely that excited about this phenomenal new talent on the niche scene. And while Melodie de l'Amour and Issara both make old genres feel new again, Oudh Inifini  could be said to do the complete opposite- to go back to the true roots of pure agarwood, long before the western world softened its edges. Make no mistake, Oudh Infini is real, raw, challenging oud- feral, animalic, and almost overwhelming- but for those with the courage to embrace it, a masterfully rich, floral, woodsy and spicy marvel lie beneath."," Laotian oud, rose de mai, orange blossom, benzoin, sandalwood, vanilla, musk, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The base is a powerful combination of dark cocoa and patchouli with an abundance of amber and a touch of sparkling vetiver to compliment the top citrus notes. The results overall are striking, both direct and powerful, but also complex and deeply resinous, ideal for a man of sophisticated style and royal bearing. The world's tastemakers have always flocked to Clive Christian for their dynamic, luxurious fragrances.

Mojave Ghost Roll-on Oil Perfume Oil,BYREDO," In the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. The ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground. Despite its arid surroundings and inability to produce nectar, the ghost flower, or mohavea confertiflora, maintains its perfect, majestic beauty and thrives year after year. In an astonishing feat of ingenuity, the flower uses mimicry to attract the pollinators of a neighboring plant species by developing markings that resemble those of a female bee, therefore attracting it and duping the male bee into following suit. This moving human-like behavior and captivating tale of survival lies in the foundation that inspired ”˜mojave ghost', an homage to this most bewitching flower.Mojave Ghost opens with a familiar yet mysterious fruit note, like a pear grown on another planet. Languid and almost buttery ambrette and sandalwood facets smooth and stretch these slices of fruit into a golden desert sunset, with petals of violet and magnolia basking in its diminishing light. Warm woods and ambergris remain on the skin for hours, prolonging a magic desert twilight."," Ambrette, sapodilla, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, ambergris, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64196.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Thus far, the secret genius of Ex Nihilo has been their ability to take conventional fragrance styles and imbue new, vivid life into them. In this re-invigoration of the amber style, Amber Sky proves yet another triumph."," Bergamot, coriander, nutmeg, geranium, amber, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Sublime Elixir de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Any release from Parfums de Nicolai is a genuine treat, a connection drawn directly from French perfumery's exquisite past to its dynamic niche present and future.

As it dries, the exotic sensuality is only deepened with a base led by castoreum, musk, and styrax. The results are captivating, unparalleled in intensity but also in sophistication.

Amber Room Eau de Parfum,Thameen," This molten scent of golden glow is inspired by the story of the Amber Room; a near mythical chamber originally constructed in Catherine the Great's Winter Palace near St Petersburg. Made from six tons of amber and decorated with pearls and precious stones, the mirrored, gilded and ambered walls reflected candlelight like fire. Rumours of its potential location come and go, but the Amber Room seems to have slipped away forever, leaving behind memories of jewelled excess and empirical vainglory. Thameen's shimmering composition is a rose at the heart of a spiced, radiant amber, dark and nuanced with cinnamon, honey and aromatic woods. A dash of bergamot adds beguiling sparkle as Amber Room opens on the skin, but it is this hypnotic candle rose effect reflecting off the lavish dose of molten amber like flames off gold in the original chamber that makes this perfume so irresistible to wear."," Cardamom, pink pepper, cypriol, cypress, cedar, patchouli, iris, oud, vetiver, amber, musk, labdanum, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The effect is both mysterious and uplifting, imposing but never forbidding, and deep with enlightened sophistication. Loree Rodkin's marvelous creations have always been a wonder for incense lovers, but Gothic V may just be the new standard.", Incense,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Indian Wood Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," With the original PG 11, Harmatan Noir, Pierre Guillaume explored the concept of a robust desert wind, carrying a powerful contrast of sweet lemon mint and Jamaican allspice on its warm, dry breezes. With 11.1, Indian Wood, Guillaume returns to the idea of the contrast between aromatics and spices, but this time the mint in question is piquant peppermint set against a rich, quintessentially Indian blend of nutmeg and cardamom, delivering a nose-tingling bouquet of energetic depth. A blend of moss and balsamic woods further adds to the robust character, while the innate dryness of the central accord is offset with a judicious touch of coconut milk. The overall effect seems to stand at the exact nexus of sweet and spicy, of warm and delicate, a balance so perfect that it seems simply effortless until one considers the contrary forces at work. Intoxicating, invigorating and playful, Indian Wood is another testament to the wondrous originality of Pierre Guillaume."," Sandalwood, vetiver, moss, spicy mint, nutmeg, cardamom, coconut milk, lemon zest",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34550.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Musc & La Peau Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," For a perfect example of how Parfumerie Generale's ReWork Collection are much more than your ordinary ""flanker"" bottles, look no further than Le Musc & La Peau. Ostensibly based on the rich chocolate and hazelnut cult classic Musc Maori, Le Musc & La Peau isolates the original's to die for milky white musk blend and strips the gourmand away, replacing it with delicate florals and light, woodsy aromatics for a second skin of refined subtlety and astonishing complexity. A peak of vanilla and tonka bean still hint at the mouthwatering richness of the original, but now they hum with gentle restraint, weaving into the warm amber heart to make your skin radiate natural sensuality. A true skin scent, Le Musc & La Peau is perfectly suited as a warm, personal base to customize your favorite fragrance, but is equally ideal to be worn alone when you just want to smell like yourself- only better."," Bergamot, ambroxan, musk, aldehydes, rosemary, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, cedar, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34549.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bergamotto di Positano Eau de Parfum,Floris London," A unisex citrus marine eau de parfum that evokes the warmth of a Mediterranean sea breeze, Bergamotto di Positano is a homage to Charles Joseph Pagliano, who in the early 19th century left the enclave of the small fishing village on the Amalfi coast to travel to England and marry his sweetheart Mary Floris. Fresh bergamot entwined with mandarin and warm marine notes brings instant refreshment. The heart is a vivacious combination of orange blossom with a hint of vanilla which lends a smooth character and creaminess to complement the initial sparkle. Base notes of wood, amber, ambrette and ginger provide the fragrance with a mellow warmth, reminiscent of a Mediterranean evening watching the stars glow against the water's surface.

As a creamy blend of coconut milk and sandalwood assert themselves, you allow yourself the relaxation that comes from knowing you're the only person for miles around, enjoying a private hideaway where nobody will ever find you. Smooth vanilla, tonka and musk complete the serene effect, comforting but slightly austere, brilliantly bright but never posh.

If it all sounds too big and rich and juicy and wonderful to be contained,  you're not far off.

L'Attesa Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," A celebration of the one of the most luxurious materials in the perfume world, L'Attesa explores iris and its many facets with an opulence that blew us away. Using three types of expensive iris, the star note is as creamy as buttered suede, and as plush as thick, silvered velvet, but also immensely floral in a way that is quite remarkable. L'Attesa opens with buttery iris drenched in sparkling champagne that bears an original, inventive touch of yeast before the fragrance transitions into a sophisticated, clean, green floral that is enveloped with refreshingly crisp bergamot, green neroli, and a plush, mossy duet of oakmoss and tuberose. In its heart phase, the voluptuously creamy, floral iris is partnered with genuine Mysore sandalwood, then with supple, smoky leather in a breathtakingly sophisticated, unisex blend that lasts for hours before finally finishing as clean floral softness.

Bertrand Duchaufour Eau de Toilette,Project Renegades," What happens when one of niche fragrance's most prolific perfumers is given the freedom to have some fun? In Bertrand Duchaufour's case, he creates a modern, zesty blend of pink pepper, woods, and aquatic notes that- not to ruin the crazy imagery- comes out shockingly relaxed and lovely. Don't get us wrong, the vibrant, spicy opening has attitude to spare, with cardamom and the aforementioned pink pepper crackling against a fizzy gin note, but somewhere in the smooth, gently resinous heart, a drop of cassis meets a rich olibanum with such sweet smoothness that we can't help but close our eyes a moment and just enjoy it all. Once the salty, ocean-tinged woods of the base set in, we're downright transported- not to a bougie beach club, mind you, but perhaps the latter hours of an all-night full moon party in Koh Phangan, as the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon and the last people standing can take a deep exhale and marvel at the craziness fading into memory. And with a delightfully woodsy, fresh, and fun memory like this, you can be sure we'll be coming back again and again."," Pink pepper, bergamot, cardamom, gin, cassis, galbanum, red berries, olibanum, hinoki, balsam fir, driftwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Geza Schoen Eau de Toilette,Project Renegades," When given the opportunity to go rogue, most perfumers might attempt to make the loudest, wildest, or most synthetically energetic fragrance of their career- but what if you've already made your whole career out of breaking the rules? In the case of visionary modernist perfumer Geza Schoen, you actually take a step towards naturalism, creating a fragrance that reinterprets pink pepper in the context of the entire tree, from berries to bark to leaves. Opening with a fresh, fruit-inflected top that merges a potent blast of pink pepper with juicy citrus and delicate, sweet and gently powdery cassis, the fragrance then adds impressive aromatic depth, with rich fir and green juniper that lend a deeply natural airy freshness. Even the warm, woodsy base balances out the dose of Iso-E Super- this is still Geza Schoen, after all- with creamy sandalwood and delicate moss, and even a dose of animalic musks to complete the illusion of a living tree with an entire ecosystem inside. Vibrant, compelling and surprisingly natural, Geza Schoen's Renegades fragrance is another triumph from a perfumer who's never been content to follow the leader."," Pink pepper, lemon, bergamot, cassis, lime, osmanthus, iris, fir, juniper, hedione, mate, iso-E super, cedar, sandalwood, labdanum, incense, myrrh, castoreum, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mark Buxton Eau de Toilette,Project Renegades," As the nose behind most of Comme des GarÃ§ons' biggest hits, Mark Buxton is no stranger to quirky, modern, exciting twists on conventional perfumery. And so it comes as no surprise that his entry in the Renegades series is indeed both quirky and dynamic, a spicy and woody floral leather with the smouldering sensuality of a young gunslinger out for revenge. Opening with a wild slash of green notes and fiery spices anchored with Buxton's signature black pepper, the scent grows all the more sophisticated with a fresh, smooth rose note set against a leather both well-worn and smoky, like a saddle broken in from years of hard riding and countless nights around the campfire. A base of warm amber and spicy vetiver-inflected woods soothes while still maintaining the frontier ruggedness that gives this fragrance its thrilling edge. Smooth and rough, dirty and floral, fiery and green- Mark Buxton's Renegades is a fragrance of intoxicating contradictions."," Basil, lentisque, black pepper, cassis, galbanum, leather, rhododendron, labdanum, gaiac, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bohea Boheme Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Majestic and remote, the rocky, mineral-rich Wuyi Mountains of China has for centuries produced some of the most exquisite, and expensive, tea in the entire world. Bohea BohÃ¨me, the newest fragrance from Maison Mona di Orio, captures the inimitable spirit of this most precious substance, distilling the rich, smoky, fascinatingly complex essence of the tea once known worldwide as Bohea into a fragrance we can truly say is unlike any tea scent we've ever smelled before. The key to Bohea BohÃ¨me's marvelous complexity is the truly astounding variety of flavors in Wuyi tea itself- at once sweet, smoky, spicy, earthy, smooth and floral. Bohea BohÃ¨me opens with bright bergamot and a punch of sichuan pepper, invigorating and intense. Delicately powdery iris adds a wholly different element of subtlety, while a more full-bodied osmanthus melds with the smoky black tea heart to feel smooth and creamy in equal measure. Green geranium and warmer amber elements only enhance the impressively cohesive complexity, and as the gorgeously woodsy drydown gradually grows, the fragrance pulses with smooth, honeyed intensity that always remains on the right side of opulent. A fragrance based on a luxurious treasure must always be wary of coming up short by comparison; luckily, Bohea BohÃ¨me is destined for a legendary reputation all its own."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, cardamom, iris, chamomile, balsam fir, boxwood, geranium, black tea, juniper, smoke, oak, sandalwood, beeswax, bay leaf, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51727.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A rich and sumptuously natural blend of white florals carries as if on the Southern Italian breeze- lily,  jasmine and orange blossom- while a delicately musky base of cedarwood and amber glows with the quiet heat of the setting sun against the sea. More than one fragrance advertises itself as ""a vacation in a bottle, "" but Azzurro di Capri is more like a portal through space and time- bringing you directly to a perfect,  timeless summer's afternoon in one of the world's most beautiful locales- no matter where you are."," Mandarin orange, bergamot, jasmine, orange blossom, lily of the valley, patchouli, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37535.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Marfa Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A arid tuberose as singularly inspired as the West Texas oasis whose name it bears. Marfa, the new scent from MEMO, captures the elusive totality of this small, isolated city- modern art mecca, historic frontiertown, legendary nexus of paranormal and extraterrestrial activity- melding the glowing warmth of desert twilight with surprisingly sweet florals and modern musks to paint a portrait of a locale that straddles regions, cultures and time itself.Marfa opens with an immediate punch of orange blossom and tuberose, fruity and sweet but also surprisingly dry, imbued with surreal weightlessness. A highway of dry, gently smooth woods stretches ahead of us, and the haunting lights of the creamy, musky base glow with quiet intensity. The notes don't seem to make sense together, and yet the collective impression is undeniably cohesive, a place that shouldn't exist and yet thrives, replacing the logic of the rest of the world with something distinctive, alien, and unexpectedly beautiful. Equal parts austere and unabashed, bold and understated, challenging and downright lovely, Marfa isn't meant to be understood- at least, not until you find yourself deep in its heart, and realizing that you never want to leave."," Mandarin, orange blossom, agave, tuberose, ylang ylang, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Carved Oud Extrait de Parfum,Thameen," This compelling blend of divine woods, patchouli and an elegantly parched oud is a scent of adornment and ritual, inspired by the Solah Shringar or sixteen adornments, a handed down ceremonial set of symbolic customs applied to Hindu brides during the wedding preparations. These detailed ordinances govern jewellery and decoration for the hair, face hands, feet and eyes. The original belief was the beautification of the sixteen body parts would protect the bride against any negative effects of the moon cycle. The rootiness of a malachite vetiver note supports the ligneous oud and an unusually nutty patchouli. A gasp of antiseptic cypriol and cypress is key as woods and powerful musks drop into skin. There is subtle power at play in Carved Oud, just enough glitter and pomp to impress, but the devil is in the graven oud, reserved and immaculate but oh-- that smoky gaiac finish-- will seduce you."," Oud, cedar, gaiac, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peacock Throne Eau de Parfum,Thameen," Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (of Taj Mahal fame..) gave orders for the construction of an opulent throne on a golden dais for the legendary Red Fort in Delhi. It took seven years to complete and was exuberantly decorated in rubies, emeralds, gold and peacock motifs. Sadly this luminous throne was looted as war booty in 1739 by the Persians and disappeared into history. The Egyptian jasmine and orris in Peacock Throne have a captivating pearlescent texture straight out of the Thameen midnight blue bottle, the extrait strength formula literally glistening on skin. Pink pepper adds a snappy aromatic crunch and a dash of rather sweet lemon stops the jasmine tumbling into indolic indulgence. The brioche and jam sensation of the trademark Taif rose has a touch of nutmeg over the top, imparting a deeply comforting aroma over a rubicund patchouli and moreish vanilla base. Everything glows like a private sunset."," Sicilian lemon, pink pepper, nutmeg, taif rose, ylang, Turkish rose, jasmine, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noorolain Taif Eau de Parfum,Thameen," Noorolain Taif is a peppery rose composition, a collision of Taif and Turkish roses lavishly dusted with pink and black peppers and a crackle of toasted coriander seed. A glimpse of jasmine glows amid the rose, just enough to add a sense of dirty sunshine. This vivacious opening is fabulous and a perfect homage to the Noor-ul-Ain or Light of the Eye that inspired it, one of the world's largest pink diamonds, mounted into a sublime tiara of the same name made by American jeweller Harry Winston. The oval brilliantine gemstone is a very singular shade of pink and this somehow feels brilliantly reflected in the glittering cannonade of rosaceous pepper at the top. Noorolain Taif is a gutsy, if not savoury experience, smoothing out as it settles into the base notes of agarwood, amber and potent cashmeran. It is a moody and regal fragrance, befitting its in namesake, but it has beautiful rose charisma and graceful longevity of hour upon spiced hour on the skin."," Orange, coriander, pink pepper, taif rose, rose absolute, jasmine, vetiver, cashmere wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Regent Leather Eau de Parfum,Thameen," This is a scent of surface, texture and finish; a deluxe and malleable composition of golden saffron-licked leather effects, unexpected citrus sparks and a purring vanilla finish. Regent Leather is a collaboration with the Rolls Royce Enthusiasts Club and pays olfactory homage to bespoke interiors, driving gloves and that elusive oh-so-desired scent of sumptuous automobile leather. The cistus in the heart of the scent, while subtle, is vital to the creation of this animalic interior, riffing off the creaminess of the saffron to suggest supple skin and spiced heat. There is a sense of being cocooned; the later gutsy base notes of smoky gurjum, cedar and spiky patchouli suggest engine growl and sunlight on seats."," Vanilla, lemon, saffron, labdanum, gurjum, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perfect Vanilla Roll-on Perfume Oil,Sarah Horowitz Parfums," We love vanilla. And not just because men go bonkers over it, although we are well aware of that fact. We love it for its own warm and comforting qualities, in addition to its devastating effect on the opposite sex. This vanilla is for grown-ups, not for little girls.  Smooth, a bit smoky and not the least bit cookie-like.

Love Shot Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," In the most romantic city in the world, classicism and sensuality are far from opposites, which is precisely how Love Shot, the newest fragrance from Ex Nihilo, manages to feel both opulently nostalgic and seductively carnal all at once. Modeled after the most iconic Parisian creations of the seventies, Love Shot is a grand, enveloping chypre rich with floral presence, but also intertwined with the sly, modern signature we've come to expect from this powerhouse line. Love Shot indeed opens with the explosives its name might suggest, a fabulous and energetic punch of fruitiness and lively florals in the form of pink berries and lush peony. In the potently romantic chypre heart, earthy and complex patchouli weaves itself around rich, true jasmine, while a spark of raspberry maintains the playful allure of the opening. As it dries, Love Shot reveals a leather and musk accord no less sophisticated for its potent eroticism. Unapologetically sexy and unquestionably dignified all at once- truly, what could be more Parisian than that?"," Bergamot, pink berries, peony, jasmine, patchouli, raspberry, vetiver, leather, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A languid vanilla and cloudy patchouli only further perpetuate the captivating complexity, signalling marvelous sophistication without ever raising the volume above a constant and soothing hum.

Eau des Sens Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," ""A piece of music that breathes on the skin"" is how Diptyque describes their new Eau des Sens, and while that might seem like hyperbole from another house, the decades-long run of uniform excellence from the storied Parisian house had us salivating to see how such a description might play out.

Built around the intriguing duality of boxing, a sport with both intensely cerebral and shockingly violent demands, The Orchid Man opens with action, a rough-and-tumble black pepper stinging like a well-placed jab, while airy bergamot lends a zesty, fruit-like feel. The heart is a jasmine and leather accord both unapologetically masculine and also proudly floral, like the orchid boutonniere that Carpentier was famed for wearing about town.

Another Oud Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Leave it to the always-playful, always-daring Juliette Has A Gun line to say what's on everyone's mind: another oud? We're the first to admit that the trend is growing a bit long in the tooth. But in perfume, as with all art, there's nothing new under the sun- what matters is how you execute, and Another Oud, all joking aside, is a refreshingly light spin on the style, a fruit-inflected, luminously light oud scent with youthful style and fun to spare. Opening with a juicy melange of citrus and tart, sweet raspberry, Another Oud presents a version of agarwood that's miles removed from the loud, dark, overspiced medicinal ouds that make up so many mediocre recent releases. This is an oud that's light on its feet, velvety-soft with a cool spiciness that never overwhelms or screams at top volume, and deftly incorporates the sweetness of the fruit-laden opening for an additional dose of playfulness. Cradled on the drydown by an ambroxan-led muskiness that's well at home amongst the other Juliette releases, Another Oud is an all-seasons, all-occasions appropriate fragrance that maybe- just maybe- justifies keeping the oud trend afloat for a little while longer."," Bergamot, raspberry, oud, norlimbanol, musk, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tacit Eau de Parfum,Aesop," As diehard fans of Aesop's beautiful, naturalistic products, we've long pined for a brand-new fragrance release to complement the fiery Marrakech Intense, as well as the wondrous bath and body products that have become an indispensable part of our daily routine. Imagine our joy when we took our first sniff of Tacit- their first brand-new fragrance release in 10 years- and discovered a stunningly bright, invigoratingly aromatic green scent with enough character and versatility to be a dynamic everyday scent for pretty much anybody. Opening with a mouthwatering, yuzu-led bouquet of citruses, Tacit quickly distinguishes itself with a strikingly intense green heart featuring an impressive amount of Grand Vert basil, the spicy, dashing variation of the plant grown in the Mediterranean. In the base, an earthy, well-spiced vetiver is given an extra zap of character from an invigorating blend of cloves for a fresh, spicy, natural-feeling fragrance to the very last sniff. Inspired by the fresh notes of traditional colognes, and also by the rugged beauty of the wildest parts of the Mediterranean coast, Tacit incorporates these elements with the signature aesthetic of Aesop to create something altogether unique, compelling, and effortlessly wearable. If you see us this summer, there's a very good chance this is what you'll be smelling."," Yuzu, citrus notes, basil, vetiver, clove",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30148.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hermann Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," A fragrance of intense duality, Hermann a Mes Coates me Paraissait une Ombre (the unabridged name is a line taken from a Victor Hugo poem that translates to ""by my side, Hermann seemed to me like a shadow"") is an exploration of your alternative self, the person who rides beside you so closely in the darkness that their opposition seems not contradictory, but rather complimentary. To represent this in a fragrance, Etat Libre d'Orange has delivered an aromatic, woody enigma of a scent both hauntingly cold and surprisingly bright. Hermann opens with chilly top notes of blackcurrant buds, and galbanum, spice without heat, maintaining an alluringly spooky disposition. In the heart, rich frankincense and peppery rose absolute add depth and character while staying shockingly weightless, allowing the aromatic notes to still filter through with impressive longevity. A base of patchouli is similarly elevated with a heavy dose of musky ambroxan, reminding us of the impossibility of holding even the largest shadow in one's hands. As Etat Libre puts it, Hermann itself stays sheer, ""enabling light to cast a shadow on your skin."" Spooky, sexy and astonishingly different, Hermann is the kind of scent we'd only expect from the always original artists of ELDO."," Blackcurrant buds, black pepper, galbanum, calypsone, geosmin, frankincense, pepperwood, petalia, rose absolute, patchouli, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47746.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Belle de Jour Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," Taking its inspiration from the 1967 classic surreal film of the same name, Belle de Jour is a flip on the expected: in this fantasy, nights are for hearth & home and days are for erotic adventures. Our lady here is utterly, unapologetically feminine; confident and contemporary, she makes her entrance with jasmine and orange flower, their soft and inviting notes draped languorously across a bed of gentle musk, green coriander, and a sweetly spiced pink peppercorn. She's pretty. She's coquettish. But she's not cutesy...she's no pouty, wide-eyed ingÃ©nue. This charming creature is a mix of modern and classic that celebrates florals while elevating them with a barely-there hint of mystery."," Coriander, pink peppercorn, orange flower, ciste, jasmin, pimento berries, cedarwood, musk, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Night Flower Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," It's 3am and she's in four-inch stilettos, sauntering home in perfect dÃ©shabillÃ© chic wearing a silk charmeuse gown, draped in vintage fur, and smoking a cigarette without a care in the world who sees... and Night Flower would be the perfume she'd wear. She's not meek or overly polite, and she likes her perfume like she lives her life: headstrong, decadent, and never prim and proper. A creamy tuberose is her fragrant weapon of choice, a sultry white blossom scent that's been a narcotic muse in perfumery for time immemorial. In Night Flower, it's sweet and buttery, contemporary and decidedly non-cloying, its larger-than-life-ness tethered by the gourmand scents of peppery-citrus bergamot, spicy-sweet cardamom, dry cinnamon, and a vanilla-esque tonka bean. A smoldering, almost leathery birch tar enhanced with soft suede is woven throughout, giving fair warning that this femme fatale of a perfume is anything but predictable or tame."," Bergamot, birch tar, cardamom, suede accord, tuberose, cinnamon, patchouli, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ma Bete Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums," The soul of Ma BÃªte is anything but conventional...but its heart beats with classic beauty and contemporary passion. The honeyed, almost citrus-like neroli and heady warmth of jasmin sambac are the beauties in charge here, leading the grounded notes at its base astray, bringing them to their knees not through raw power but with finesse. BÃªte is not a brash, in-your-face floral, nor is it ruled by untamed earthiness; it's all about the dance, the give and take, the unleashed femininity of sparkling, aldehyde-enhanced florals wrapped around the gentle, resinous warmth of cypriol, nutmeg and styrax. The anchoring scents of cedar, animalic notes and light touches of patchouli are reserved, but they drive an evolution so remarkable it becomes almost a wholly new fragrance as time passes. Where you start with this one is not where you end up, begging the question: what is beauty without her beast?"," Neroli, aldehydes, nutmeg, cypriol, styrax, Jasmin sambac, cedarwood, patchouli, animalic accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

In a word, the ultimate stealth scent.  This convenient Travel Set contains three 11ml travel spray bottles of Aqua Universalis, the perfect way to take it on the go no matter where your journey takes you."," Bergamot, Sicilian lemon, lily of the valley, sweet mock orange, light and musky woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49843.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Audace Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Sumptuously smooth, seductively spicy, Audace lives up to its name by delivering a woodsy, aromatic vetiver scent with attitude to spare. Combining complex, spicy anise with bracing bitter orange, smooth cedar, and a dry, rich vetiver, Audace stuns with its depth of character and sensual warmth. Though it glows with a robustly masculine, rugged charm, we can't help but swoon at the thought of how gorgeously it might wear on a confident and creative woman as well. The only thing you really need to wear Audace? As much passion and inspiration as the fragrance itself."," Licorice, bitter orange, cedar, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33941.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," In the Fall of 2014, Baccarat, the most prestigious and opulent crystalworks in the world, celebrated the 250th anniversary of their founding by releasing an extraordinary crystal decanter containing a luminous, exclusive fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian. Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. MFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The ""breeze"" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling ""heat"" accord. Finally, a ""mineral"" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. A fragrance that was only meant to belong to 250 of the world's wealthiest collectors is now available, and we could not be more thrilled to offer it."," Citrus, jasmine, saffron, sage, ambergris, oakmoss, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49842.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Bergamote Soleil Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," Impossibly bright, deliriously fresh, and enticingly nostalgic, Bergamote Soleil is the latest triumph from Atelier Cologne's consistently excellent Collection Originale of elegant citrus-based colognes absolues. Based around a very high concentration of superior bergamot harvested from the island of Calabria, Bergamote Soleil effortlessly weaves a narrative of old friends and joyful reunions against the sun-kissed coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. As the name (or any familiarity with its Collection Originale siblings) would suggest, Bergamote Soleil is all about the citrus. And what a citrus it is, a gorgeous Calabrian bergamot that overflows with crisp brightness and a just-right hint of bittersweet peel. Lush touches of ambrette and white amber lend gentle smoothness, while lightly spicy vetiver and cardamom give character without excess body, all atop a casually sexy oakmoss base.

Farnesiana - Eau de Parfum,Caron," Only a few noses have dared in making mimosa into a perfume. Born in 1947, Farnesiana remains to be one of the most exceptional and unique mimosa perfume blends on the market. In order to capture its duvet-like appeal, Michael Morsetti turned to the extraordinary lesser known variety of mimosa, sweet acacia. This essence's Latin origin (Acaciosa Farnesiana) provides the inspiration for its name, reminiscent of Rome's FarnÃ¨se Palace and sweet Mediterranean refinements and aromas."," Mimosa, sandalwood, hay",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/553170.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Kemi Eau de Parfum,Kemi," KÃªme,  the ancient Egyptian word for Egypt itself,  is a name shrouded in mystery and power. So knowledgable and renowned was their mastery of art,  science and sorcery that Al Kemi (or the later simplified version,  alchemy) literally means ""Egyptian arts, "" in tribute to their mystical powers. Kemi the fragrance is,  too,  a tribute to that ancient wonder,  a wondrous blend of smoky,  animalic and gourmand notes that weave a primal and magical tapestry. Kemi opens with a robust,  dark,  and woodsy combination of real oud and rich cedarwood,  leading into a heart of gurjan balsam delicately sweetened with caramel and given sensual depth with animalic castoreum and civet. The robust,  lightly creamy base of vanilla and sandalwood multiplies the swirling depth,  while accentuating the diversity of the composition. Mysterious yet dignified,  attention-getting and subtly wondrous all at once,  Kemi is a miraculous fragrance of ancient pedigree."," Cedar, oud, gurjan balsam, caramel, civet, castoreum, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

From the initial citrus burst to warm embracing base notes, it manages a nonchalant sophisticated aura that is so hard to achieve. A bright burst of citrus notes begin the symphony as a rare pineapple note delicately sweetens and rounds out the initial greeting. Soon, a complex array of floral spicy notes of jasmine, iris and pink pepper break the initial bond and brings about a seductive interplay that only heightens the senses. Finally, a warm embracing blend of patchouli, amber, musk and vanilla round out the composition and provide a final bow to the symphony of notes."," Hyacinth, pineapple, iris, jasmine, pink pepper, vetiver, musk, patchouli, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Purple Reign Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," As music lovers with two ears and a soul,  we naturally love Prince,  so anytime the Purple One is being referenced in a fragrance,  we're paying attention. But when the fragrance is a new release from natural perfume's brightest light,  Tanja Bochnig,  with a stated purpose of ""improving self-awareness and raising energetic vibrations, "" with special emphasis on ingredients that are actually,  well,  purple,  then we're really invested.

Les Indes Galantes Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," With Les Indes Galantes, Parfums MDCI continues the exotic journey around 18th century Asia that was started with this year's Cio Cio San. But while Cio Cio immersed us in the pastel loveliness of Edo-era Japan, Les Indes Galantes whisks us thousands of miles south-west, to the vibrantly colorful worlds of India's long-lost Mughal Empire and British Ceylon. The results are a sumptuous, creamy, spice-laden delight, a complex and enchanting fragrance that walks the line between mouthwatering gourmand and exotic oriental with tantalizing confidence. Les Indes Galantes opens with a zesty burst of light, as sun-drenched bergamot and juicy orange and raspberry explode off the skin, with a ribbon of rich almond subtly hinting at the gourmand complexity underneath. In the robust heart, the full oriental spice bouquet shimmers, with rich Persian cinnamon and fiery clove supporting the ravishing vanilla that defines much of Les Indes Galantes latter phases. Supported with a subtly powerful leather and smooth, ambery labdanum, the vanilla thrums in rhythm to the spice blend, seducing us with its wondrously creamy fullness, but never drowning out the complexity of the other notes. Complex and captivating, Les Indes Galantes is another sweeping triumph from Parfums MDCI."," Bergamot, orange, almond, raspberry, coriander, cinnamon, clove, geranium, vanilla, leather, incense, benzoin, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Oud Vendome Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," There's no question that oud is the ""it"" ingredient of modern perfumery, but so many oud scents are so content to re-hash the tried-and-true combinations that we can't help but feel that the ""modern"" part of it has gotten a bit lost. Not so with Oud VendÃ´me, a genuinely modern oud that folds the smoky, intensely full-bodied titular ingredient fully into the contemporary Parisian chic style that Ex Nihilo does with such panache. Oud VendÃ´me opens with a spicy touch of saffron set against crackling ginger and cinnamon, balanced for the perfect burst of fresh, modern energy. The heart and soul of the fragrance is the robust agarwood (oud) accord, its richness and depth perfectly complemented by earthy galbanum and fresh, noble cedar, which keep Oud VendÃ´me feeling powerful, musky, sensual and vibrant, with a truly chic European presence. Urban, youthful and 100% Parisian, Oud VendÃ´me is a east-meets-west stunner."," Saffron, ginger, galbanum, cedar, oud accord, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Hauto Parfum Extrait,Jeroboam," During the Roaring Twenties, French Cancan dancers in the celebrated cabarets of Paris had a ritual of perfuming ""every hill and valley""- wherever they wanted to be kissed. We'll leave the specifics up to your imagination, but Hauto (""skin"") is such a shamelessly alluring, relentlessly sexy scent that anyone who wears it should have no trouble being kissed wherever they desire. Opening with an explosion of crisp citrus and juicy pineapple, Hauto wastes no time sliding into its alluring heart notes of carnal tuberose, lush rose petals and just the right amount of spice to add contrast and depth to the florals without crossing over into outright oriental territory. Instead, the tuberose holds sway, balancing the floral lushness with enough of the star ingredient's distinct, minty naturalism to maintain the Jeroboam line's uniquely modern style. In the base, Vanina Muracciole's signature enigmatic musks thrum with sensual energy.

Upper Ten Eau de Parfum,Lubin," The Upper Ten Thousand- or ""Upper Ten""- was the phrase coined by the American poet Nathaniel Parker Willis in 1850 to refer to the captains of industry and uniquely self-made aristocrats who willed America from an uncertain experiment into the global titan of the Industrial Age.

In its drydown, the clouds part to reveal ambered incense laced with a plush creaminess, soft woods, and hints of nutty sweet myrrh. Sacred, mysterious, powerful, and contemplative, LAVS fills you with a serenity that made it the choice for two Popes to scent their holy vestments. Yet, we think the fragrance has a universal appeal, evoking not only the radiance of ancient ceremonies, but also joyful celebrations and the innocence of childhood. Try it, and see for yourself."," Jasmine, Cardamom, Black Pepper, Elemi, Coriander, Clove, Carnation, Labdanum, Opoponax, Palisander Rosewood, Amber, Oakmoss, Tonka Bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Prestigium Eau de Parfum,Mancera," An intoxicating combination of a woodsy chypre scent mixed with an intense floral leather, Black Prestigium has the self-assured sophistication and stylish presence of old-world royalty. Asserting itself from the very opening with an indulgently rich dose of orris blended with patchouli and bergamot that emphasize both fresh and earthy tones, Black Prestigium quickly adds a deep floral heart to the equation, with lush rose and sweet violet atop deep, vibrating woodsiness. As smoky oud and leather join the ever-increasing symphony, the orris continues to shine, each sniff revealing a new dance partner that accentuates a different element of this astonishing natural ingredient. The results are breathtakingly diverse, yet utterly cohesive. A fragrance for special people and special occasions, Black Prestigium may be Mancera's most opulent fragrance yet."," Bergamot, orris, spices, patchouli, rose, violet, oud, cedar, gaiac, sandalwood, amber, leather, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64929.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shazam! Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Oriental fragrances, by their nature, tend to aim for excess: more spices, more notes, more complexity, all in the pursuit of creating the rich, exotic depth inherent to the genre. But 4160 Tuesdays has never been the type of line to indulge in over-seriousness and groupthink, so Shazam! isn't your typical oriental- a tighter, more direct blend of indulgent amber, fresh spice, and surprising citrus and aromatics, Shazam! is both comfortingly rich and refreshingly direct- a true oriental for an oft-overwrought genre. Opening with juicy fresh tangerine and strikingly aromatic basil and juniper, Shazam! quickly warms up with a heart of rich woods, savory cardamom and smooth frankincense livened up with zesty pepper. As the incomparably gorgeous amber base develops, you realize that this is everything you love about oriental fragrance with none of the chaff. As the name suggests, Shazam! is fierce, striking and direct- a bolt of lightning to liven up a sometimes stodgy genre. We're paying attention."," Basil, tangerine, juniper berry, atlas cedar, pink pepper, cardamom, olibanum, amber, patchouli, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64621.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aoud Vanille Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Warm, rich, mysterious and striking, Aoud Vanille is a captivating scent that hovers between oriental and gourmand. The aoud here is front and center, anchoring a powerful opening of sharp agarwood, savory cardamom and redolent saffron that quickly disavow any notions that this will be an overly dessert-y pushover. A floral heart softens things slightly in transition to the vanilla-driven base, but it's a vanilla with backbone, anchored by a full bodied woodsiness that confirms Aoud Vanille's unisex bona fides and keeps the central vein of aoud detectable for hours. If Aoud Vanille is a gourmand, then it's one reminiscent of bold, adventurous cooking from a top tier chef; if it's an oriental, it's swathed in the precise, creamy comfort of a grand master. We'd prefer to think of it as the best of both worlds."," Oud, saffron, black pepper, cardamom, floral notes, vanilla, gaiac, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64928.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Cassis Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's wondrous perfumes have always achieved an impressive balance between glamorous elegance and youthful vitality, but Hedonist Cassis, a delightfully juicy, vividly fresh, sumptuously immersive new scent, is perhaps her most youthful and vital yet. Built around a beautiful burst of blackcurrant- sweet, tart and mouthwatering- Hedonist Cassis positively sparkles with energy and joy from the very first spray. But Hedonist Cassis is more than just a pretty face- beneath the delectably juicy top note, a sophisticated heart of lush Bulgarian rose and fresh-cut grass feels both seductive and compellingly natural, while a delicate yet persistent base of incense and cedar lends subtle, dynamic depth. Presented in Viktoria Minya's beautiful signature bottle loaded with stunning Bohemian crystals, Hedonist Cassis is another triumph from one of the best independent perfumers out there."," Blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, grass, cedar, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cologne 352 Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," It's easy to fool yourself into thinking all cologne-style fragrances are the same- fresh, fleeting, and, dare we say, forgettable. But while Cologne 352 keeps the crisp citrus top notes and energetic orange blossom of an Italian classic, the signature scent of Ex Nihilo's Rue Saint-HonorÃ© boutique is a different kind of cologne- one with a surprisingly lush floral component and a substantive woody-musky drydown that make this particular cologne uniquely, distinctly Parisian. Opening with a gentle yet brisk splash of Italian lemon made aromatic with a tinge of juniper, Cologne 352 builds to a sophisticated crescendo of orange blossom softened with rose and delicate muguet, presenting crisp and lush notes that evoke morning strolls through Latin Quarter gardens. In the lovely, lingering drydown, a substantive dose of cedar, gaiac and musk gives Cologne 352 a staying power that its Italian ancestors can only dream of, and a unisex appeal impossible to deny. Whether you love cologne or not, you've never tried one like Cologne 352."," Lemon, juniper, crushed leaves, orange blossom, rose, lily of the valley, white cedar, gaiac, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois d'Hiver Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo," ""An iron fist in a velvet glove, "" Bois d'Hiver is a seductive ode to contrast,  where spicy,  powerful woods and powdery musks intertwine with astounding fluency to create a scent that can only be described as equal parts striking and smooth.Bois d'Hiver opens with a hypnotically spiced blend of pink pepper and cardamom,  both sourced from Givaudan's industry-best Orpur naturals. The electricity of the spices gives way gradually to a robust cedar-and-sandal woodsiness rounded with smooth,  clean florals,  while a rich Indonesian patchouli lends just the right amount of earthy body. In the drydown,  a base of powdery,  exquisitely fine musk counterbalances the woods,  producing an alluringly symbiotic fragrance both modern and compellingly easy to wear. Your contradictions are what make you dynamic. Shouldn't the same go for your fragrance?"," Pink pepper, cardamom, heliotrope, cyclamen, white cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, cypriol, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose of No Man's Land Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Rose of No Man's Land is a uniquely beautiful and soothing rose scent presented for an especially worthy cause. Developed in collaboration with supermodel Freja Beha Erichsen, Rose of No Man's Land is dedicated to the praiseworthy work of MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Doctors Without Borders), an independent medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare.Rose of No Man's Land is centered around the delicate petals of a Turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. A radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity.For each bottle of Rose of No Man's Land sold, Byredo pledges to contribute a portion of the sale to Doctors Without Borders."," Pink pepper, Turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, Turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64183.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opus 1144 Eau de Parfum,UNUM," All the drama of a diva, all the radiance of a legend, Opus 1144 comes bedecked with the glittering sparkle of citrusy gems atop an opulent, Shalimar-style ball gown of sumptuous vanilla and heady jasmine. A soft, lacy veil of benzoin and iris powder masks her eyes, while musky, sexy ambergris drapes around her shoulders, and ripples of smoky leather, dark resins, incense, and spicy sandalwood swirl at her feet.Decadent, alluring, sophisticated, and extravagantly rich, Opus 1144 takes French classicism and gives it a modern gourmand twist. At the same time, its lush femininity is layered with darker, drier, and more masculine notes that slowly rise to the surface, lending the fragrance a unisex appeal. Opus 1144 knows how to make an entrance, but it will sweep you off your feet from start to finish."," Elemi, Jasmine, Bergamot, Mandarin Orange, Iris, Orchid, Cashmere Wood, Musk, Ambergris, Vanilla, Leather, Sandalwood, Benzoin, Styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rosa Nigra Extrait de Parfum,UNUM," A sophisticated, polished, and modern take on the woody floral, Rosa Nigra crosses fragrance genres like a chameleon. Its enchanting opening begins with a radiant floralcy that smells like roses coated with succulent peaches and dusted with warm spices atop a rich sandalwood base laced with artemisia that bears tantalizing oud-like facets. Artemisia is the source of absinthe, once called ""Green Fairy"", the legendary drink of artists who relied on its mystical aromaticism to transport them to new worlds. It transforms Rosa Nigra's middle stage with refreshingly crisp herbal greenness, spicy geranium-like leafiness, and masculine woods whose quiet smokiness is counterbalanced by floral iris and clean musk. In the drydown, the enticing, complex, and mysterious bouquet is transformed again by waves of creamy sandalwood, silky vanilla, golden warmth, and a mellow muskiness. From start to finish, it's a fascinating, brilliantly balanced, and incredibly elegant fragrance."," Star anise, artemisia, freesia, sandalwood, peach, cashmere wood, amber, musk, vanilla, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Noir 29 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," ThÃ© Noir 29 is an ode to the noble tea leaf and the craft that surrounds it. Combining depth and freshness, softness and strength, this uncharacteristically structured wonder stuns us through permanent oscillation between the light of bergamot, fig, and bay leaf, and the depth of cedar, vetiver and musk. A special extraction of black tea leaves wraps up the composition by bringing a dry, leafy, hay-like tobacco feeling in the dry down to transform this creation into a sensuous and addictive essence.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Complimentary Le Labo samples: Available with any product purchase.

10 Corso Como Eau de Parfum,10 Corso Como," 10 Corso Como is exotic sensuality, the meeting of the arcane and the new. It's a clean, warm sandalwood with a touch of churchy frankincense and an ingredient so expensive, so precious, so rare that we dare not speak its name but once. This is not your local headshop's version of sandalwood, so forget about multi-colored dancing bears and hookahs; 10 Corso Como's mystery is rooted in one of the most ancient of all incenses, yet it remains light on the skin, exuding a scent both delicate and intensely spiritual. Without a single ad campaign, 10 Corso Como has attracted so many crazed worshippers in Europe that some buy the bottles by the dozen. Welcome to paradise."," sandalwood, frankincense, musk, rose, geranium, vetiver and rare Malay oud wood oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/12400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tabac Tabou Extrait de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Long before it was commodified and commercialized by Europeans, tobacco had a long history in the indigenous Americas as a sacred plant, smoked or burned for shamanic healing, purification and dream-vision rituals. This is the inspiration for Tabac Tabou, a tobacco perfume unlike any other, which strips away the preconceptions of cigarettes and cigars and Western indulgences and returns this holy crop to the natural domain from which it originally draws its great, mystical power. In Tabac Tabou, the tobacco leaf arrives folded in whiffs of fresh hay and wild landscape, rich and utterly untamed. A green, fresh narcissus meets white flowers, rough-hewn leather and compellingly fur-like animalic notes. Sweet, honeyed immortelle supports the main ingredient's natural sweetness, while unannounced secret ingredients lend incredible depths of earthy yet delicate nuance, confirming our feeling that this isn't so much a standard fragrance as it is a direct pipeline to a mystical world that used to be. Featuring a high quantity of extremely rare and precious materials, Tabac Tabou is now part of Parfum d'Empire's permanent collection, but the fragrance will be produced each year in restricted quantities, with the label indicating the vintage."," Immortelle, tobacco, narcissus, honey, grass, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35717.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
African Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," For the fourth installment of the Cuirs Nomades series, exploring various facets of leather scents through a global journey, MEMO has abandoned the peculiar comforts of Europe (previous editions in this series were French, Italian and Irish) for a taste of the wild. Like the bright Kenyan sun above the plains of the Serengeti, African Leather is at once impossibly vibrant and undeniably full of life, a deeply aromatic, richly spiced floral leather with all the soulfulness and natural magnetism of the world's last unspoiled habitat. African Leather opens with a burst of gorgeously vivid exoticism, as stunningly bright bergamot illuminates a wondrous and wild blend of green, herbal spices, cardamom, cumin and saffron combining for a hugely evocative, ruggedly sensual set of top notes. In the grassy, floral heart, wild vetiver combines with a stunning geranium absolute that delivers commanding depth and a feral edge that rolls perfectly into the titular leather, a majestically unpolished, animalic leather that evokes tooth and fur, hide and claw, feeling as savagely regal as the great beasts of the savannah. Take an unforgettable journey with African Leather, and get in touch with your wild side."," Bergamot, cardamom, saffron, cumin, geranium, patchouli, oud, leather, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chrysolithe Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," Mentioned in the Bible,  Qu'ran and holy texts across Asia,  chrysolithe (now often called peridot) is a gem-quality stone with a gold-green glow brilliant enough to more than explain why it inspired so much superstitious wonder across the ancient world. In his latest“poem of stones, ” Olivier Durbano celebrates the majestic power of this magical and precious material with a spectacular scent,  equal parts fresh,  spicy,  green and warm,  that shifts from woods to aromatics to spice with captivating,  sparkling unpredictability. While Chrisolythe seems to have little use for the typical top-heart-base structure,  the first blast seems to give you a taste of everything,  with fresh,  tart verbena glowing against a mÃ©lange of dazzling spices and fiery ginger. As the uniquely green hyssop note emerges,  its raw,  camphorous qualities supplement various notes at random- for a moment pairing with rich cedar and sweet musk,  then changing to favor aromatic sage and rosemary or delicately floral jasmine. As might befit a stone imbued with ancient and mystical power,  we can't fully define what makes Chrysolithe so compelling. But there's no denying that its dynamic,  aromatic,  mysterious aura has absolutely cast a spell on us."," Caraway, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger, sage, rosemary, jasmine, cedar, vetiver, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," Everyone loves the smell of vanilla, and yet somehow the perfect, universally wearable vanilla seems elusively rare- mouthwatering bakery gourmands scare away lovers of wispier, more floral concoctions, and both varieties are often seen as too feminine for men to wear. This is why we're so enthused with Dominique Ropion's brilliant creation for A Lab On Fire-- a just-right vanilla musk that we think smells divine on just about anyone. This enchanting elixir is sweet without seeming gooey, compelling without shouting in your face, and romantic with enough restraint to wear well on men and women alike. A soft rose lends its velvety tones throughout, darting in and out among the star players of clean musk, rich tonka bean absolute, vanilla, and amber. The ever-so-slightly powdery almond notes of heliotrope are the perfect complement, softening and rounding out the sweet toffee and barely-there blonde woods. Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is a season-spanning wonder, displaying a warming sweet coziness on cool fall days, while bergamot and peach blossom bring a fresh, light addition to summer sunshine. With versatility like that, it's no wonder that Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is one of the best crowd-pleasing vanillas we've ever put our noses on.Formerly known as Mon Musc a Moi. Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is the same perfume, now with a new name."," Bergamot, peach blossom, rose, heliotrope, musk, toffee, amber, white woods, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Taking its inspiration from an original sandalwood fragrance that dates back to the 1800s, Santal EDT modernizes a classic by lending it a distinctive, contemporary edge. Santal opens with crisp bergamot and lemon zest cut through with fresh notes of green grass and a spicy blend of black peppercorns, clove bud, green cardamom and nutmeg. The warmth of the spices merges with the lavender in fougÃ¨re accord as the sensual woody notes of sandalwood, cedarwood, patchouli and vetiver unfold and are augmented by the oriental base notes of frankincense, musk and vanilla."," Bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, green grass, lemon, clove bud, lavender, nutmeg, amber, cedarwood, frankincense, musk, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elite Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Introduced in 1979, Elite was named after Lotion Elite – a Floris after shave cream that dates back to 1851. Based around mellow woodsy notes, Elite turns up the intrigue with a cool citrus twist of bergamot, lemon and orange punctuated with green resinous notes of cedar leaf and spicy juniper berry. Lavender and fir balsam with a touch of bay are key to the character of the heart and are reinforced by the woody notes of patchouli and vetiver. Mossy notes then play a leading role as the fragrance evolves with amber, musks and a hint of leather in the base."," Bergamot, cedar leaf, grapefruit, juniper, petitgrain, fir, lavender, bay leaf, amber, oakmoss, musk, cedar, patchouli, vetiver, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 89 Eau de Toilette,Floris London," Orange and bergamot blended with lavender and neroli give No.89 its classical cologne aspect. Warmed with a touch of spicy nutmeg, the floral heart is underscored by the dominant woody accord of sandalwood, cedarwood and vetiver in this quintessentially English gentleman's fragrance.No 89 takes its name from the number of the Floris shop in Jermyn Street. Introduced in 1951, it has amassed generations of devoted followers including James Bond creator Sir Ian Fleming."," Bergamot, lavender, neroli, nutmeg, orange, petitgrain, geranium, rose, ylang ylang, cedarwood, musk, oakmoss, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Lush, seductive, and more than a little dangerous, Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi is a fragrance of nocturnal temptations, where the darkness of night leaves pleasure seekers free to explore their deepest desires far from prying eyes. Lush, woodsy and mouthwateringly sumptuous, the latest from Kilian's In The Garden Of Good And Evil is a bona fide delight- being wicked never smelled this delicious.Like joining an all-night party in full swing, Voulez-Vous opens with its full-bodied florals already singing, the sweetness of the ylang and lushness of Bulgarian rose playing off of the creamy, narcotic tuberose. As a rich, lusciously creamy vanilla with a sexy cedarwood kicker grow in intensity, we're positively swept away in the sensuous festivities. Cancel your plans for tomorrow, because Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi is going to keep you away from home until the sun comes up."," Neroli, ylang ylang, tuberose, gardenia, Bulgarian rose, vanilla, cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Cashmere Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Warm, creamy and deliciously sweet, Ambre Cashmere Intense is a delectable gourmand that marks a bright new era for Parfums de Nicolai- the first scent created by Patricia de Nicolai in collaboration with her son, Axel. And lovers of the sweet will have ample reason to celebrate the new arrangement, as Ambre Cashmere Intense is a richly sugared lemon-vanilla delight with a heart of sophisticated, buttery iris and a warm amber drydown that has us swooning. From the beginning, Ambre Cashmere Intense presents itself as more than your average gourmand, with a tingling black pepper leading the way into the sweet, intensely vanillic lemon. A strong dose of iris butter forms a delicately floral richness in the fragrance's heart alongside the dominant vanilla absolute, while a patchouli-inflected amber accord settles in for a long, comforting drydown as cozy as a fragrance named ""cashmere"" might suggest. Indulgent, mouthwatering and deeply relaxing, Ambre Cashmere Intense is gourmand bliss, on demand."," Black pepper, mandarin, lemon, orris butter, violet, clove, vanilla absolute, labdanum, benzoin, tonka bean, patchouli, sandalwood, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31353.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Palao Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," As complex and gorgeous as the Zellige mosaic tiles from which it takes its inspiration, Diptyque's first foray into oud fragrance is an enchanting, exotic work of art all its own. Built around the titular Palao, a robust and renowned oud extract found only in Northern Laos, Oud Palao showcases all aspects of this wondrous ingredient- dark woods, sensual animalics, and creamy depths, all balanced against rich Bulgarian rose, and a deep, spiritual incense blend. In the smooth, rich drydown, sandalwood and vanilla add depth and longevity, while the lusciously elegant oud lingers, delivering a perfectly measured drop of smokiness alongside lightly earthy patchouli and resinous labdanum. The resultant balance is so smooth, so sumptuous, and so easy to love that we can picture it holding center stage at the most lavish of galas, or just as easily, keeping you company by a roaring fire on a moonlit night. In other words, as perfect of an oud fragrance as Oud Palao may be, it is, first and foremost, a perfect Diptyque."," Bulgarian rose, oud from Laos, Madagascar vanilla, tobacco, rum, sandalwood, labdanum, patchouli, camphor",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483184.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noir Exquis Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The Parisian patisserie is so much more than a simple shop- it's a place of wonder, where exquisite pastry and invigorating coffee aromas set the backdrop for timeless friendships, fierce intellectual debates, lazy afternoons, and chance romantic encounters. It was the last of these things, the idea of love blossoming over eclairs and cafÃ© au lait, that inspired Bertrand Duchaufour to create Noir Exquis, a wondrous new gourmand that combines the mouthwatering scents of a patisserie with a deep, sophisticated, and luminous base of woods and floral amber that sings of attraction, connection and delight. Noir Exquis opens with a succulent combination of sweet orange and deep, rich chestnut, which soon opens up to a heart of syrupy maple and a true, full-bodied coffee that balances as perfectly against the sweets as the real thing. As it dries down, a delightful, lightly almond-inflected heliotrope blends perfectly with a creamy vanilla, while a notably darker wood note, described here as ebony, lends a dynamic and romantic touch to smoother, lightly powdery notes of tonka and sandalwood. What Duchaufour has created here is not a mere representation of a patisserie, but rather a capsule of every positive feeling one could associate with such a place. The results are truly lovely, and we're happy to say that Noir Exquis is a creamy, sweet, beautiful new achievement for one of our favorite perfumers."," Chestnut, orange, orange blossom, coffee, maple syrup, ebony, heliotrope, vanilla, tonka, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
PHI Une Rose de Kandahar Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Phi is a luxurious scent, inspired by a natural extract of roses produced in Afghanistan's rose region, Nangarhar. This rose oil is extremely rare and of highest quality. Inspired by these roses, growing in a dry and rough land, Phi is a rare gem, complementing contrasting lines, rich in natural raw materials that add depth and authenticity. Due to the limited amount of the rose oil, Une Rose de Kandahar is not guaranteed to be available all the time.The scent starts with a rich fruity line of apricot. An all natural apricot extract with its surprising richness enchants and blends into a stretch of cinnamon and  hints of bitter almond, softened by bergamot essential oil. These spices lead over to voluptuous roses in the fragrance heart: Extremely rare rose essential oil with its unique scent of spices, plums and flower petals blends into rose absolute from Bulgaria and hints of Bourbon geranium. The rose petals melt on the skin into a dark tobacco fond, built around an amazing absolute of dried tobacco leaves. The animalic, leathery and woody tobacco opens the ground for a generously dosed layer of patchouli in the base of Phi. Here, woody and gourmand notes melt into hints of animalic lines. Vetiver, vanilla and tonka add richness and brilliance. A generous dose of exclusive musk and ambergris round the body of the fragrance and encircle the roses."," Apricot, cinnamon, almond, bergamot, Bulgarian rose absolute, rose from Kandahar, bourbon geranium, tobacco leaf, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, musk and ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31431.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sotto La Luna Tuberose Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," The genius of Andy Tauer has always been his ability to see past- or perhaps to not see at all- the conventional, in service of his own unique perception of the scents and notes he loves. So while for most, a ""natural smelling"" tuberose would default into cool, creamy rich white floral territory, Andy's Sotto La Luna Tuberose turns in the other direction, envisioning a beguilingly green, peppery floral that brings the ""queen of the night"" into bright, warm daylight.    Long time Tauer lovers will have particular reason to rejoice, as from the very first clove-spiced, galbanum-rich spray, it's clear that Sotto La Luna Tuberose is a throwback to Tauer's most iconic and distinct fragrances. Weaving through the rich spicy warmth of this full dose of ""Tauerade"", the heavy dose of natural tuberose absolute asserts herself-- creamy and floral as you'd expect, but so expertly blended against sweet ylang and stemmy jasmine as to bathe the notes in vibrant warmth and fresh green tones that feel spicy, natural and utterly unique. As the soft woods, patchouli and briskly musky ambergris base emerges, the tuberose is both softened and elevated, wonderfully recognizable while still leagues apart from any tuberose we've smelled before. Is Sotto La Luna Tuberose a typically unadorned soliflore? Perhaps not traditionally. But in a very real sense, that's exactly what it is: A singular, artistic vision of tuberose, as only Andy Tauer could bring us."," Cinnamon, cloves, galbanum, geranium, tuberose, ylang ylang, rose, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31432.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin Angelique Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," When most fragrance houses announce a jasmine scent, it doesn't necessarily move the needle, but as a house dedicated solely to cologne-style compositions, the notably indolic, sensual white flower might seem a bit more challenging. Luckily for us, Jerome Epinette and Atelier Cologne have done it again- Jasmin AngÃ©lique is a stunning, crisply complex cologne absolue that balances layers of herbaceous green notes against a lovely, lilting jasmine accord that feels natural, fresh and warmly comforting. Jasmin AngÃ©lique opens with a crisp, spicy burst of Sicilian lemon, set against a fiery, energetic kick of Sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced by a floral yet fresh jasmine, resinous galbanum, and a lovely green fig note, which together give the impression of breathing deeply while walking through a meadow on a warm spring afternoon. This wondrous sensation lingers for hours, until slowly warming into the smooth, warm and light amber drydown. Vivid, green and aromatic, Jasmin AngÃ©lique is wholly unlike any jasmine fragrance we've tried before- and that's precisely what we love about it."," Lemon, Sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Cendre Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," Enigmatic, elegant and enchanting, the iris is one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients- and also one of its most challenging. So when we heard that Naomi Goodsir's first-ever floral was to be named Iris CendrÃ© (or ""Iris Ash""), our hearts began to flutter with anticipation of an Iris fragrance that might transcend convention and offer a bold new portrait of this beloved material. And even beyond our wildest dreams, Goodsir and perfumer Julien Rasquinet have delivered a bona fide masterpiece- a lush, warm, buttery interpretation of iris with a gorgeously restrained hint of smokiness that feels both wonderfully creative, and quintessentially Naomi Goodsir.Before even the first spray, Iris CendrÃ© affirms its rarity with a striking green color that results from its uniquely high concentration of true iris concrete, a property that gives the fragrance its striking depth and nuance. While the opening presents a crisp, delicately fruity burst of bergamot and spiced tangerine, the rich heart of buttery iris soon takes over, displaying a gorgeously evocative facet of the flower with warmer, more sultry tones than we've ever before found in an iris scent. A light veil of violet reinforces the floral depth, while a sensually smoky accord of cistus, tobacco and amber evokes the distinctly complex drydown of another Naomi Goodsir classic, Bois D'Ascese. The overall effect is both subtle and striking, a wholly unisex floral that seems to contain multitudes without ever raising its voice, feeling vivid and deep but also masterfully restrained. With Iris CendrÃ©, Naomi Goodsir and Julien Rasquinet have redefined what we thought an iris scent could be and in doing so, created a new reference."," Bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bahiana Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," Oh to be in Bahia, hypnotized by the incessant beat of the drums, dancing under the stars with a caipirinha in our hand. Sadly, we are here, instead. At least we have Bahiana, which lets us dream of hot Brazilian nights. A brilliant burst of sharp citrus fuses with exotic deep woods and coconut to create a fruity blend that is more dry than sweet. It reminds us of pineapple – not drenched with syrup, but freshly cut, with a startling trace of green. As vivid as a caipirinha, and almost as intoxicating."," Brazilian orange, caipirinha limon, mandarin, tagette, green leaf, rosewood, gaiac wood, elemi, amber, musk, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29323.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Incense Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville," For the third entry in his joyfully creative Tauerville project, Andy Tauer turns his attention to an ingredient that his primary line has ample familiarity with: incense. And while Incense Flash's woods-and-incense motif seems to cover some familiar ground, we're pleased to report that this earthy, leathery, compulsively sniffable scent walks a deft line between comfortable and creative, with ample appeal for lovers of Andy's previous incense work and newcomers alike. As would befit a fragrance named Incense Flash, the incense buzzes from the very first spray, dry enough to bring out the natural earthiness of the Boswellia Serrata incense used, but supplemented with a subtly musky, woodsy sharpness- dare we say a hint of the famous Tauer signature? As Incense Flash dries, the incense lingers, now paired against a wonderfully evocative leather- rough and dusty, yet as it dries increasingly supple and smooth. What now lasts for hours is a new reference for incense scents, less forest, painter's studio or bazaar and more starlit, high desert vista. Distinct, compelling and easy to wear, Incense Flash is at once uniquely an Andy Tauer creation- and also something altogether new."," Leather, musky woods, ambergris, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Framboise Noire Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue," Like an aged wine in an ancient cellar, Framboise Noire is a testament to the darker side of berries and wood, a celebration of the complexity that can be achieved in pitch blackness. Opening with a note of rare black raspberries mixed with a handful of juicy red forest berries, Framboise Noir begins both sweet and nuanced, before a heart note of seductive iris adds floral depth and a modern touch. A base of rich white oud and dark, musky black woods increases the sensuality, igniting the palate and deepening the sophistication. Sweet, rich and more than a bit dangerous, Framboise Noire is an enticing invitation to discover what lurks in the darkness."," Black Raspberry, mixed berries, iris pallida, white oud, black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Halfeti Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons," Sumptuous and mysterious, lush and spicy, Halfeti builds on the promise of the previous entries in Penhaligon's Trade Routes series by delivering an exotic and beautiful rose fragrance that sings with the luxuries of the 19th century's most rare and valuable trading commodities. Named for the gorgeous and exceedingly rare black roses found along the Euphrates river in Turkey, Halfeti takes this rose note- luscious, lightly fruity, fresh and rich- and sets it amongst notes of juicy, sharp grapefruit, fresh green vegetation, and a mouthwatering melange of culinary spices anchored with golden, redolent saffron. As the rose increases in intensity, joined by lightly indolic jasmine and fresh lily, a rich, regal base of leather, oud, patchouli and precious woods lends sophisticated depth, calling to mind a merchant ship returning to port, overflowing with priceless goods. Such is the balance of this exquisite fragrance that spicy and soft, lovely and dark, complex and comfortable all blend in perfect harmony, with that singularly beautiful rose standing tall in the middle. Rose fragrances come and go, but a treasure like Halfeti is a rare find indeed."," Grapefruit, bergamot, green notes, armoise, lavender, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, saffron, violet, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, cypress, muguet, leather, oud, amber, resins, cedar, patchouli, tonka, vanilla, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ryder Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo," Ryder Street in St. James is the home of some of London's most exclusive, timeless members clubs- enclaves of prestige and legacy where modernity gives way to perpetual elegance and dignity and taste reign supreme. As the second fragrance from Ex Idolo, Ryder captures this rarefied aesthetic perfectly, presenting a boozy, sweet tobacco/amber scent that exudes luxury, while adding an indolic twist of jasmine that modernizes the experience for today's unisex audience. With the additional incorporation of precious and rare Hojari frankincense from the desert of Oman, Ryder maintains its exceptional feeling of opulence from the beginning of its lifespan to the very end. Sweet and spicy, rich and luxurious, Ryder is the kind of extraordinarily complex tobacco scent that doesn't just come along every day, or for that matter, every year.

Venetian Bergamot Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Bergamot- fresh, fruity, spicy and complex- is perhaps the most unsung hero of perfumery of all styles and histories. Without bergamot, eaux de cologne lose their snappy freshness, fougeres forego their bracing sharpness, and chypres fall into flat, heavy dullness. It's therefore only appropriate that Tom Ford's new Venetian Bergamot, a modern-facing blend of these renowned styles of fragrance, keeps the noble bergamot front and center, sweeping us off our feet with the versatility and vibrancy of Italian bergamot carefully supported in a lush, fresh, spicy blend of woods and florals that refreshes and intoxicates all at once. Delicately creamy magnolia and sweet, fleshy gardenia and ylang ylang embrace smooth, robust cedarwood and cashmeran, while a sweet/spicy duo of black and pink pepper dance above the ground, each aspect enforcing and complimenting an aspect of the exquisite bergamot oil at the top of it all. Tom Ford has given fragrance's hardest working ingredient its very own feature- and we couldn't be happier."," Bergamot, black pepper, pink pepper, ginger, ylang ylang, gardenia, cedar, pepperwood, magnolia, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber, cashmeran.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63541.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Vierge de Fer Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens has a history of playful names that subtly subvert the fragrances they're attached to,   but naming a lush,   gentle lily after a medieval torture device might take the cake. ""La Vierge de Fer,  "" after all,   translates to ""the iron maiden,  "" that infamous spiked coffin more associated with heavy metal than French fragrance. But as always,   there's a method to the madness,   with La Vierge revealing itself to be a beautiful lily-led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening and lightly metallic incense base suggest the maiden's deadly spikes with a wink and a smile.La Vierge de Fer opens,   as we mentioned,   with a bright dose of aldehydes,   charging the concoction with tingling energy and subtle sweetness. As the floral heart warms,   jasmine brings the luscious fullness,   while lily provides the edges,   fresh,   green and yes,   lightly metallic. This last,   thematically appropriate element is further reinforced with the incense base,   while the musk accentuates the sweetness that also carries throughout the life of this fragrance. Sure,   we can see the subtleties that must have put a smile on the Serge Lutens team's faces when they chose to name this fragrance after the iron maiden. But to us,   this gorgeous,   sophisticated,   easy to wear floral is the opposite of torture."," Aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36153.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Don Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club," Everyone, at some point, has daydreamed of becoming a mob boss. While we wouldn't recommend actually pursuing that dream, we have a better solution: Don, a rich, addictive new fragrance from Join The Club that captures the seductive mystique of the criminal underworld. One sniff of Don, and you'll feel transported to an era of double-breasted suits, tommy guns, and smoke-filled speakeasies. Rich, spicy Cuban tobacco leads the way, along with the sweet, warm depth of whiskey. Danger, in the form of a tingling gunpowder accord, pairs perfectly with a fresh whiff of crisp stacks of cash. Spicy, masculine, and impossibly smooth, Don has the ruthlessness of a gangster- but the style of a gentleman."," Gunpowder, money, Cuban tobacco, whiskey, molasses",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63211.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mojave Ghost Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," In the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. The ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground. Despite its arid surroundings and inability to produce nectar, the ghost flower, or mohavea confertiflora, maintains its perfect, majestic beauty and thrives year after year. In an astonishing feat of ingenuity, the flower uses mimicry to attract the pollinators of a neighboring plant species by developing markings that resemble those of a female bee, therefore attracting it and duping the male bee into following suit. This moving human-like behavior and captivating tale of survival lies in the foundation that inspired ”˜mojave ghost', an homage to this most bewitching flower.Mojave Ghost opens with a familiar yet mysterious fruit note, like a pear grown on another planet. Languid and almost buttery ambrette and sandalwood facets smooth and stretch these slices of fruit into a golden desert sunset, with petals of violet and magnolia basking in its diminishing light.  Warm woods and ambergris remain on the skin for hours, prolonging a magic desert twilight."," Ambrette, sapodilla, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, ambergris, and cedar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flowerhead Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," In the traditional Indian wedding, flower heads are strung together on giant leis, including Jaimala garlands which are exchanged between bride and groom as a token of mutual respect. Couples are often showered with petals by the groom's brother for spiritual protection. Flowers are abundant; from the mandap wedding canopy, which is entirely covered in exotic blooms, to the spiritual pooja rooms and verandahs, the explosion of colour is wildly celebratory and the scent is overwhelming.Ben Gorham, the visionary behind Byredo, used his impression of a bride in a Traditional Indian wedding as his inspiration for Flowerhead.“The idea of marrying someone you don't know was very interesting. There's anxiety and excitement, and I described this person as a ”˜flowerhead', because the bride is completely covered in floral hair arrangements.”Flowerhead has definitely set our hearts a flutter. It's a bold yet modern white floral; on one hand, it uses the classic combination of sambac jasmine and tuberose for it's floral heart, but without the slightest touch of cream or indole usually associated with white florals. Instead, the dryer aspect of white petals is blended with with a green rose, tart lemon and cranberry. Angelica seed adds a celery-green herbal dimension. Flowerhead doesn't shy away from the the classic white floral silage or volume. In fact we find this to be one of Byredo's most robust compositions yet-- after a slow gorgeous drydown, Flowerhead softens to a lingering wisper of suede and ambergris."," Angelica seeds, cranberries, sicilian lemon, sambac jasmine, rose petals, tuberose, suede and ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monoscent G Eau de Parfum,What We Do Is Secret," What, exactly, is Galaxolide Super, the sole aromachemical responsible for Monoscent G? In simple terms, it's a synthetic ingredient with a light, clean, musky vibe that has been used in fragrance creation since standard Galaxolide was created in the 1960s- the powered-up ""Super"" version featuring light floral-powder tones came in 2007. In Monoscent G, Galaxolide Super finally steps out from behind the crush of perfume ingredients and stands alone. The result is a tantalizingly subtle skin-musk that can be either worn alone for a barely-there spritz of sexiness, or used quite effectively as a base layer for other fragrances, where it adds both longevity and an almost subconscious sensuality. However you choose to deploy it, Monoscent G is a secret weapon in any modern fragrance lover's arsenal.Please note that Galaxolide is a very subtle fragrance that cannot be detected by everyone. We definitely recommend trying a sample before buying!", Galaxolide Super,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The natural rarity of ambergris and its precious properties have rendered it mythical.Ambre Gris emphasizes the richness of the amber, with the rose absolute in the heart, and the vanilla absolute in the base for a sophisticated perfume.

Patchouli Nosy Be Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Nosy Be (or Nossi-BÃ©) is an island off the northwest coast of Madagascar, commonly known as the ""scented island"" due to the abundance of extremely high-quality perfume materials grown on its northern half. But patchouli, a sensitive and delicate plant to cultivate, has never been able to thrive in Nosy Be's intense heat. Until now. Perris Monte Carlo Patchouli Nosy Be contains the very first magical harvests of authentic Nosy Be patchouli, made possible through an innovative and painstaking process that involves transplanting developing plants by hand into shaded, protected areas amongst the ylang ylang plantations, which results in an extraordinary patchouli essential oil with unique dry, woody and cocoa-like properties.

Ylang Ylang Nosy Be Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," Nosy Be (or Nossi-BÃ©) is an island off the northwest coast of Madagascar, commonly known as the ""scented island"" due to the abundance of extremely high-quality perfume materials grown on its northern half. Of these ingredients, the ylang-ylang grown by Robertet is among the most unique and treasured. During an arduous 12 hour distillation process, only 6kg of ylang ylang essential oil is produced from every 300kg of raw flowers used, and the resulting oil is spectacular- creamy, fruity, carnal and exotic. Perris Monte Carlo Ylang Ylang Nosy Be, produced only from the tiny portion (generally under 2%) of each distillation determined to meet the ""Extra"" quality designation, is a spectacular floral, showcasing every bit of ylang's distinct and versatile character.

For the gentleman who wants to display his own versatility and determination, Galloway, with its spicy-fresh blend of citruses, florals and musks, makes a powerful, yet easygoing, statement. The star of Galloway is evident from the very beginning, a gorgeous spicy-fresh hesperide blend made from the peels of a melange of juicy citrus fruits, equal parts invigorating and fiercely masculine. A heart of earthy iris keeps us grounded in the crags and glens of Scotland, while a drydown of sexy musk and not-too-heavy amber gives backbone and longevity. Like the horse that bears its name, Galloway will always get the job done, no matter the terrain."," Hesperides, pepper, iris, orange blossom, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Godolphin Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," The Godolphin Arabian, as the progenitor of the modern thoroughbred- it's estimated that at least a third of modern racehorses descend from his line- would have to be considered one of the most singularly influential horses in world history. To honor this incredible stallion, Parfums de Marly has created a fragrance every bit as regal, dignified and sophisticated as the Godolphin himself, an elegant leather scent of undeniable power. Godolphin is based around a sumptuous leather accord, equal parts rich, sweet, powdery, spicy and distinct. The opening is fresh, with thyme, saffron and cypress, while a rich, jammy rose combines with jasmine and buttery orris to anchor a smooth, sensual heart. You don't have to own prizewinning thoroughbreds to wear Godolphin- but you'll be smelling so powerful, you'll feel like you do anyway."," Aromatic notes, thyme, spices, saffron, green notes, cypress, mate, fruit notes, rose, orris, jasmine, white cedar, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Herod Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," One of the most accomplished racehorses (and prolific studs) of 18th century Europe, Herod was a horse of uncommon achievement descended from a famous line of Turkish warhorses. To honor him, Parfums de Marly has created a truly spectacular fragrance, one that combines robustly masculine tobacco, wood and patchouli notes with an alluring spice blend and a sumptuous vanilla. Herod opens with an attention-grabbing spicy mix of cinnamon and peppercorns, and quickly introduces a resinous, sultry heart of incense and tobacco, combined with such smoky-sweet artistry that it makes our mouths water and pulses race all at once. In the base, the woodsier and earthier aspects are enhanced with rich patchouli and vetiver, while a creamy, delectable vanilla keeps things from ever getting too dark or deep. Rich enough to wear on a cold winter night but well-rounded enough for year-round, Herod is a luxurious addition to any gentleman's arsenal- and we think it would be drop-dead sexy on any lady who loves tobacco scents as well."," Cinnamon, pepperwood, osmanthus, tobacco leaves, frankincense, cistus, vanilla, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Centrepiece Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Originally created from a chance selection of ingredients and accords that inspired relaxed, peaceful feelings, Centrepiece is that most fundamental of 4160 Tuesdays-style creations- lighthearted, inspired, devoid of typical haute perfume pretension, and downright lovely. Focused around the sweet, tropical floral note of frangipani, Centrepiece further adds to the indulgent (but never cloying) bouquet with sweet honey and creamy vanilla, balancing it all against green tea and rich but gentle cedar. The results are entrancing, an everyday-suitable, gently powerful white floral that soothes, seduces and relaxes in equal measure. Simply beautiful."," Honey, green tea, vanilla, frangipani, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pegasus Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly," Pegasus- the horse God, the heavenly stallion portrayed in Coustou's famed statue. A creature of such power, refinement and nobility that only a God himself would dare attempt to ride him. In this spirit, Parfums de Marly's Pegasus is, itself, fragrance nobility- a skillfully refined take on the fougere style featuring unexpected notes of almond and vanilla that give it unique lasting power and striking dignity. Pegasus opens with the aforementioned almond note- lightly sweet, somewhat bitter, and warm, given juicy heft by a more traditionally fougere-like bergamot. The heart of the fragrance further expands on the almonds' sweet, marzipan-like depth, while an unlisted floral accord (lavender and jasmine?)exudes gentle, refined masculinity. In the base, vanilla is the clear star of the show, replacing a traditional fougere's mossiness with creamy warmth supplemented by amber notes, while a light, sharp sandalwood keeps everything airy enough to still earn the genre. To read the notes of Pegasus is to wonder how it earns a categorization as a men's fougere- to smell it, on the other hand, is to be so swept up in its sophistication and majesty that you've no choice but to understand."," Bergamot, heliotrope, spice, almond, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ilha do Mel Eau de Parfum,MEMO," Ilha do Mel,  or ""Isle of Honey, "" is the affectionate named bestowed by Brazilians to this beloved destination off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Gorgeously picturesque,  Ilha do Mel features no roads,  no automobiles,  and almost no development of any kind- simply sandy paths connecting postcard-perfect beaches and stunning coastal views. To capture the spirit of this stunning locale,  MEMO has delivered a bright yet richly sweet floral as sunny and relaxing as a perfect day at the beach. Ilha do Mel opens with a beautifully crisp burst of juicy mandarin and floral-green hyacinth,  given lovely contrast with concentrated oil of juniper seeds (Ilha do Mel is a part of MEMO's Graines Vagabondes collection focusing on seeds). The true richness,  however,  lies in Ilha do Mel's honeyed heart,  where a syrupy richness flavors a lush bouquet led by gardenia,  jasmine and iris. A vanilla bean base adds creaminess but never even approaches heaviness- this is truly a day spent in the sand and sun. Gorgeous,  carefree,  and soothing- isn't it time you took a trip to the Isle of Honey?"," Oil of mandarin, hyacinth accord, oil of juniper, broom flower absolute, gardenia accord, iris concrete, jasmine absolute, orange blossom absolute, vetiver, musk, oil of vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cedrat Boise Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Fresh, fruity and yet utterly masculine, Cedrat Boise has received a steady buzz of excitement amongst fragrance aficionados since its release, not least for a purported resemblance to a certain holy grail fruity men's scent with a bit of a more expensive pedigree. And while we see several key differences between the two, what can't be denied is that Cedrat Boise is the equal to any casual-yet-sophisticated masculine on the market. Opening with a bright, zesty burst of blackcurrant and citrus, Cedrat Boise quickly layers on a sexy heart of jasmine and patchouli underneath the still-lingering fruity freshness, staying crisp for hours before slowly easing into a sumptuous drydown of cedar, sandalwood, leather and musky mosses. Gorgeously blended and all-season appropriate, Cedrat Boise is a remarkably versatile and enjoyable masculine- the one to reach for when you can only reach for one."," Bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant, cold spices, fruit basket, aquatic jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar, leather, moss, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64923.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wild Rose Aoud Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Yes, we've all tried a rose and oud scent before. But when it's done as well as Wild Rose Aoud, it feels brand new all over again. Featuring a sparkling bergamot and lemon opening and a rich heart of exquisite Turkish rose to go with a deep, resinous oud base, Wild Rose Aoud isn't reinventing the style so much as perfecting it. Casual enough to wear every day, but captivating enough for the special moments in life, Wild Rose Aoud exudes an effortless beauty that will steal your heart."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, jasmine, patchouli, amber, musk, sandalwood, oud, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lemon Line Eau de Parfum,Mancera," A testament to the energizing, sensual power of citrus, Lemon Line proves that simplicity can be incredibly sexy. Featuring a crisp, aromatic, intoxicatingly fresh lemon note, Lemon Line pairs it with Mancera's signature white musk and a delicate lavender-led floral bouquet, lightly supporting the energizing tartness of the lemon, while a sharp oakmoss accord lends further depth and keeps the lemon note true throughout the long-lasting drydown. Is Lemon Line simple? Absolutely. And that's what we absolutely love about it."," sparkling lemon, orange, lavender, white flowers, amber, geranium, white musk, oakmoss,",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1888 Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," From the exquisite house of Xerjoff comes a rare and unique scent based on a never before released blend from the ancient perfume house of Casamorati, 1888, a rare and ethereal blend that transports the wearer to a bygone era of elegance and grace. Coriander, cloves, green pepper and Iranian saffron are gently married with a masterful blend of Bulgarian rose from Grasse, Moroccan neroli and Indonesian ylang ylang. This intoxicating bouquet is gently layered over a rich and creamy base of Mysore sandalwood, patchouly, amber, and rich leather notes from the Russian birch tree."," coriander, cloves, green pepper, Iranian saffron, rose from Grasse, Moroccan neroli, Indonesian ylang ylang, mysore sandalwood, patchouly, amber, Russian birch tree",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67410.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mefisto Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," While the name may conjure images of fire and brimstone, Casamorati's Mefisto is anything but demonic. Devilish, maybe, as in a combination of citrus, florals and woods in a classic Italian style so devilishly handsome that it's near impossible to resist. In fact, from the so-fresh-it-makes-our-mouths-water opening, to the incredibly smooth lavender and rose masculine floral bouquet of the heart, through the clean, crisp, musky drydown, the whole thing is- now that we think about it- so smoothly seductive that maybe we ought to give the devil his due. Who else could make something this clean and casual feel so sexy?"," Fresh citrus, calabrian lemon, grapefruit, bergamot, lavender flowers, damascene rose, white flowers, florence iris, neroli, cedarwood, Haiti vetiver, vanilla bourbon, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fiero Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," What makes a masculine fragrance old-school: ingredients, strength or style? In the case of Fiero, it's all of the above- a powerhouse of citrus, neroli, vetiver and spices with a classic fougere-style sensibility that's as captivatingly seductive as it is intense. Opening with bright, tart lemon, Fiero quickly starts rounding out its profile with the development of clean, full-bodied neroli, adding a green freshness. As the scent drys further, a dizzying array of spices and spiced ingredients come to the fore: rich, smoky vetiver, sharply bitter tarragon, and soapy, musky freshness that all combine to radiate classic, extremely sexy confidence. Signature scents can't leave much more of a signature than this one."," Bergamot, calabrian lemon, lemongrass, blood orange, thyme, lavender flowers, estragon, mint, neroli, nutmeg, mysore sandalwood, patchouli, vetiver, coumarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Regio Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Perhaps no fragrance better captures the essence of the Casamorati line- inspired by the fabled fragrances of a house that stood centuries ago, yet brought proudly into the modern world- than Regio, a full-bodied masculine floral of the sort that simply no longer exists. Opening with the kind of brilliant citrus burst Xerjoff is famous for, Regio quickly takes a turn towards the old school, with a sweet, fruity carnation accord that blends with lavender, geranium, ylang and a solid dose of nose-tingling spice. The base is at once musky-soft and resolute with woods, patchouli, and delectable vanilla, recalling a foregone era where men allowed their fragrance to sing out, showing strength through tastefully-deployed exuberance rather than yawn-inducing sameness. Spicy, floral, sophisticated and unique, Regio is a fragrance fit for a 18th-century aristocrat- or a 21st century celebrity."," Lemon flowers, calabrian bergamot, lavender flowers, grapefruit, ylang ylang, Damascan rose, geranium bourbon, Guatemalan cardamom, Damascan plum, cloves, Indonesian patchouli, vanilla beans from Zanzibar, white musk, ambrette seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber & Roses Eau de Parfum,Mancera," Richly resinous, deeply floral and intensely musky- Amber & Roses, from Mancera's“Dark Desires” series, more than lives up to its name. A deeply sensual rose, fleshed out with icy Sicilian lemon and rich Indian jasmine, stars opposite a labdanum and amber-accord combination that explores every sweet, resinous possibility of the ingredients, a syrupy-rich base that rests underneath the florals rather than drenching them. And the sharp, sexy musk that could be considered the Mancera trademark makes an appearance two, grounding the amber accord just enough to make it year-round wearable. Straightforward and potent, Amber & Roses is a fragrance for the bold and sensual."," Sicilian lemon, rose, jasmine, labdanum, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1861 - Zefiro Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Rome- the eternal city, a bustling modern metropolis with thousands of years of history beating in its heart and etched into its streets. Zefiro pays homage to Rome's baroque alchemy, a fragrance with both the instant appeal and the grand mystery of such a prestigious capital, suggestive and elusive, vibrant and unknowable. Zefiro opens with the lavish giddiness of il dolce far niente, a long weekend of fine wine and rich fruits. Cardamom and cinnamon evoke both mouthwatering cuisine and the well-spiced bustle of Rome's never-ending crowds, while iris and carnation represent beauty in all forms, from the perpetual spring season to the fashionable beauties in every square and nightclub. But Rome is also a city of history, and as Zefiro dries down, a rich amber and smoky incense remind us that around every corner is another masterpiece-stuffed museum, extravagant palazzo, or Imperial stronghold. And yet, a sweet, pervasive honey holds the earlier notes in place as well- after all, Rome isn't a city that changes, but a city where ancient and modern take root together in a hypnotic whirl."," Bergamot, Wine, Resins, Davana, Cardamom, Carnation, Cinnamon, Iris, Honey, Frankincense, Agarwood, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1861 - Naxos Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," The most passionate and sensual area of a country that has never lacked for either, Sicily is a land of tradition and emotion, a rich Mediterranean island where nature and ancient history flow through every village and hillside. Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. Naxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present. Beautiful and wild, both ferocious and gentle, Naxos is the essence of a a place that has always been and will always be."," Bergamot, Lemon, Lavender, Jasmine, Cinnamon, Honey, Cashmeran, Tobacco, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51141.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," What does happiness smell like? Surely, there are a million individual answers, and yet White, the result of Puredistance and Antoine Lie's quest to create a fragrance that would instantly evoke intense joy, glows with an undeniable, universal radiance. Born from the uncompromising quality of vision and material that Puredistance has become renowned for, White is much more than an ordinary bright, lush floral: it's a genuine work of breathtaking, yet nuanced, beauty that's impossible to dislike.The true, joyous beauty of White lies in its structure, which neither conforms to the traditional top-heart-base note configuration, nor is it what we normally consider linear. Instead, White is a giddily rotating ensemble of gorgeously lush Rose de Mai, immaculate sandalwood, lightly potent vetyver, orris butter and patchouli, and exquisitely deep tonka bean. One sniff may distinctly carry orris' powdery violet-like essence, another, luscious full-bodied rose, the next, rich, vanillic tonka. It's the type of elegant sophistication we've grown to expect from Puredistance, a compliment that makes White no less amazing. If Puredistance's goal was to create a scent it would be impossible not to smile around, then we're happy to say they've succeeded with flying colors."," Rose de Mai, tonka bean absolute, orris absolute, sandalwood, bergamot, musk, vetyver, patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cio Cio San Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Picture a stage set with paper lanterns and parasols, the rustling of silk kimonos, and trees bursting with cherry blossoms – the heightened, glowing version of a far-off place that you might see at the opera. Here you will find the endearing and ever-hopeful Cio Cio San, whom you might know better as Madame Butterfly. Forget, for a moment, her tragic ending and think instead of the heroine who lives in a happy bubble of memory, a confection of young love and nostalgia that is as lovely and fragile as her namesake. This scent evokes Cio Cio San's happiest days, opening with an exhilarating splash of yuzu, limette and ginger that is joined by a profusion of flowers. The first impression is that of walking into a garden in full bloom, but the heady peonies and cherry blossoms quickly become light and sheer as the exquisite sweetness at the heart of the fragrance appears. Lychee is an incredibly distinctive note that blends delectable juicy fruit with a soft, rose-like quality--it is both instantly familiar and impossible to place, like a candy eaten in a dream. A watercolor wash of oolong tea adds to this wistful nostalgia, creating an ethereal finish that is both clean and vibrant. Like a haiku that can conjure up an entire scene with a few well-chosen details, Cio Cio San is a serene meditation that evokes the springtime and romance of old Japan with heart-twisting clarity."," Yuzu, limette, lemon, ginger, grapefruit, cherry blossom, peony, lychee, oolong tea, gaiac, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orangea Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Naturalistic, fresh, and yet subtly sensual, Orangea is the smell of a modern Italian Garden of Eden, where young lovers intertwine beneath an orchard teeming with bitter oranges, a passionate embrace devoid of self-consciousness or shame.Opening with a brightly intense spritz of bergamot, Orangea quickly surrounds us in orange trees, a petitgrain-led burst of fresh, lightly bitter, subtly floral orange notes that at once refresh and excite. Crisp mint speaks of both innocence and sensual invigoration, while a light cedar drydown gives backbone. Passionate yet carefree, sensuous yet fresh, Orangea is a celebration of pure natural delight."," petitgrain, bergamot, mint, cedar leaves",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33940.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Satin Mood Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," In the expert hand of Francis Kurkdjian, oud is more than a trendy ingredient or predictable element- it's a fabric, to be spun into pillow-soft, dazzlingly sheer compositions that take our breath away. Oud Satin Mood, the newest from this master craftsman, weaves a shimmering robe of oriental spices, exquisite oud, elegant florals and a mouthwatering base that combine to flow across the skin in delicate ecstasy. Each breath brings new delights, from the bright, lightly candied violet of the heady opening, to the smooth, purring Laotian oud that curls on contact with a regal Bulgarian rose essence and Turkish rose absolute, softening into a rich, vanilla-scented amber accord that gently caresses every inch of your skin in a cloud of pure sensuality. As befitting a satin garment this elegant, Oud Satin Mood would surely turn every head wherever you might go- but when it makes you feel this incredible, are you sure you don't want to stay in?"," Agarwood, Bulgarian rose, benzoin, Turkish rose, violet and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49840.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grisette Eau de Parfum,Lubin," In the Belle Epoque, a grisette referred to the stylish young women employed in droves in Paris' booming sewing workshops. A fixture in the bars of Montmartre and the guinguettes on the Marne, the grisette was flirtatious, fun-loving, liberated, and full of the joie de vivre that inspired so much of the era's famed art and culture. Now as the newest fragrance from the venerable house of Lubin, Grisette is poised to capture the essence of these beautiful, industrious coquettes with a crisp, lush, spirited fragrance that you can hardly sniff without a smile. Grisette opens with bright citrus notes of grapefruit and bergamot, evoking the sun shining along the Seine as young roses- Moroccan and Bulgarian, presented as lovely and unpretentious as can be- wafts across the waters. Using for the first time an alcolate of rose concrete, Lubin has managed to preserve the most volatile and lively of the rose notes, which mingle with a touch of grapefruit to positively dance off the skin. Discreet heart notes of orris oil are cloaked in incense and hints of cedar wood with touches of musk and amber melt into the scent of Madagascan vanilla absolute. Joyful, playful and utterly gorgeous, Grisette is a fragrance for the spirit of youth within us all."," Citrus, grapefruit, bergamot, rose concrete, iris concrete, incense, musk, amber, cedar, Madagascan vanilla absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31221.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sombres Dessins,Jovoy Paris," Sandalwood expresses a somber beauty. Alone, it's almost supernatural, a spellbinding essence expressing boundless sensuality. Sombres Dessins is a fragrance for a man, or woman, with a secret, a hidden power, a desire to keep some aspect of themselves hidden, until the moment it matters most.Sombres Dessins is a spellbinding trap, a warm and suave cocoon, weaving heady spices, flowers hidden in a sensual bouquet, and a gorgeously complete sandalwood- at times sharp, creamy, rich and wholly seductive- showcasing the full power and depth of this most precious of ingredients. Dangerously seductive and breathtakingly complex, Sombre Dessins is a siren song from which there is no escape."," Italian bergamot, pink peppercorn, modern rose, osmanthus, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood, labdanum, olibanum, rum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61612.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sans Un Mot Extrait de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," Picture a perfume that parts the heavens, that stops men and women alike dead in their tracks, that grants the woman who wears it the power to suspend an entire airport terminal or street corner frozen in rapture, eyes suddenly darting towards the source of such stunning beauty? In French, they call such an experience un ange passe, literally,“an angel passes.” And with Sans Un Mot, Jovoy has created a new great French powdery floral.Sans un Mot opens with a spicy burst of pink peppercorn and zesty mandarin before moving into the rich, neo-classical heart of rose, ylang, and juicy blackcurrant. A finish of powdery musk and vanilla grounds it firmly in the tradition of classic French floral orientals, while an unexpectedly modern dose of soft woods and violet remind us that this is indeed the 21st century.  The angels who take our breath away are often in and out of our lives before we know it. But Sans Un Mot can be yours forever."," Pink peppercorn, Italian mandarin, modern rose, ylang-ylang, blackcurrant, vanilla, violet, iris, powdery musk, white musk, soft woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61613.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanilla Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville," The success of Rose Flash- so fresh, so wonderfully wearable, and yet so different from the Tauer scents we already knew and loved- had us salivating at the prospect of future Tauerville releases. Now, with Vanilla Flash, Andy Tauer has turned his considerable talent and imagination towards the goal of creating a vanilla fragrance he'd actually like to wear- meaning sickly sweet, overly creamy or referentially foody was out the window. The result, instead, is something only Andy could dream up- a spicy, earthy, robustly savory vanilla scent that dries down to a sophisticated, surprisingly sexy spiced vanilla. It's a thrilling synthesis- a wholly unique scent that defies the notion of what a vanilla is supposed to be and yet is available at a shockingly affordable price. Vanilla lovers, vanilla agnostics and aspiring Tauerville residents alike: Vanilla Flash is a must have."," Spices, Vanilla Bourbon, Rose, Patchouli, Tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Musc Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Is the new Musc Extrait the perfect form for Bruno Acampora's widely beloved Musc? After all, while the classic oil is still renowned for its originality, depth and jaw-dropping longevity, and the Eau de Bruno spray is similarly worshipped for its versatility, sensuality and warmth, the Extrait encompasses all of this and more. Still steadfastly true to the deep, damp earthiness of the opening and the toe-curling pleasure of the richly comforting drydown that follows, Musc Extrait ups the ante with a satisfying floral sweetness that appears after the first spray and lingers through the gorgeous evolution that follows. It's everything you know and love about Bruno Musc- only even better.  ""The Extrait of perfume is the holistic expression of Acampora's collection. An ideal point of contact between the pure undiluted Essences (oils) and the classic Eau de Bruno (Eau de Parfum).

Precision & Grace Eau de Parfum,The Beautiful Mind Series," For Volume 2 of this fascinating collaboration with exceptional women from diverse fields,   perfumer Geza Schoen chose to team with Polina Semionova,   an internationally-fÃªted ballet dancer.“I was fascinated by what goes on in the mind of a great dancer while she's dancing,  ” says Schoen,   ”˜in the precision she must have to express the grace.” The result is Precision & Grace,   a stunningly balanced modern fragrance that marries uplifting fruity notes to soft florals,   all perched atop a warm,   deceptively strong woodsy drydown. I wanted to have pear and plum because they remind me of summer in the Russian countryside of my childhood,  ” says Semionova. The top note of Williams pear brings forth a crisp,   juicy greenness. The heart of the fragrance is an accord of Egyptian jasmine with plum,   meant to evoke the lightness of a ballerina's gossamer costume. Finally the base of Precision & Grace,   a powerful yet subtle real sandalwood and musk combination that shows the tremendous physical strength that a dancer must possess in order to project the sublimely delicate beauty visible to the audience. Breezy and feminine,   yet hiding a deeper core of power and strength,   Precision & Grace is another unique and fascinating triumph for The Beautiful Mind Series."," Williams pear, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, Egyptian jasmine, plum, osmanthus, rose, mimosa, pink pepper, freesia, violet, sandalwood, myrrh, moss, amber.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fauna Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," An enchanted oudh for creatures of the night, Fauna paints a picture of a nocturnal wonderland teeming with magical life radiating in the faint glow of the stars. Unleashed by the retirement of the waking world, creatures great and small embark on their nightly routine, their raw animalic odors softened by the ghostly night-blooming cereus, the greenness of the forest, a tantalizing vein of delicate spices that lingers in the atmosphere. Genuine Laotion and Indonesian agarwood extractions howl, and rich albino musk howls back. Don't be frightened, though; Fauna is strong and complex and your eyes aren't made to see in this kind of darkness, but if you remember your place in this wondrous kingdom, you'll be just fine."," Laotian and Indian agarwoods, saffron, coffee blossom, sumac, grains and nuts, petitgrain bergamot, castoreum and ghostly notes of nightblooms and albino musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freeworld Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," What,  precisely,  defines an“American Oriental, ” as Ezra Woods and Alia Raza have chosen to categorize freeworld? We think a single sniff might be all you need to understand- while freeworld features a positively intoxicating mÃ©lange of spices and a warm,  earthy base that would more than qualify it as an oriental,  it crackles with a youthful exuberance and energy that paint a dramatically more upbeat,  casual picture than the snarling,  sultry grand dames of classic European takes on the genre.  With bright,  lemony geranium standing in for more opulent florals,  sparkling aldehydes and fizzy citrus adding light and levitation,  and a mouthwatering nutmeg and vanilla blend evoking memories of ice-cold root beer on a sweltering summer night,  freeworld feels as American as New York pizza,  apple pie or baseball- a few other things we once borrowed from overseas."," Geranium, citruses, neroli, nutmeg, coriander, sandalwood, vanilla, and aldehydes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Room 237 Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," It's not everyday that we get a fragrance based on one of the most terrifying films ever made, but that's precisely what Room 237 is- an homage to Kubrick's classic adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining, where the pastel-green bathroom of the titular room shelters an unspeakable evil. It's not exactly the kind of concept one attempts lightly, but Bruno Fazzolari has delivered something truly unique, a soft, enveloping, soapy-green scent that powerfully evokes a feeling of dreamlike confusion that's both wearable and, dare we say, at least a little bit disturbing. Like its source material itself, Room 237 doesn't smash you over the head with its more transgressive elements, but rather it draws you further into the room with Kubrickian deliberation- clean musk and resin flow together with synthetic plastic and vinyl notes that assert themselves in waves, keeping you sniffing at your wrist even though you know something about it feels wrong.  And just as Jack Torrance couldn't see the truth of Room 237's lone resident until he was at the edge of her bathtub and it was far too late, so too will you fall prey to this fascinatingly constructed fragrance. Horror fans, fragrance adventurers- you absolutely have to try this for yourself."," Angelica, Flea Bane, Estragon, Costus, Oppoponax, Olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monserrat Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Like any true beauty, Monserrat is so much more than just a pretty face. Which is to say, while you may find yourself swooning over its luscious, brightly fruity opening, this is no simplistic department store fruity floral. It's a Bruno Fazzolari, and that means that what starts as a straightforward- if mouthwatering- burst of juicy peach and green grapefruit soon grows far more literate and complex with a delicately indolic jasmine and an unexpected plaster note that recontextualizes all that vibrant fruitiness into something delightfully dry- as if you were looking at a CÃ©zanne still life so masterfully done that you find yourself wishing you could take a bite. Fruity florals often get a bad rap, and not always undeservedly. But if they were all as clever, innovative and compelling as Monserrat, even the most die-hard critic might be singing a different tune."," Pink Grapefruit, Green Leaves, Carrot Seed, Osmanthus, Jasmine, White Musk, Setting Plaster",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69305.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sunshine Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Bright and joyful, Amouage's exuberant new fragrance shines like a desert metropolis at high noon. Sunshine opens with glowingly youthful top notes of almond, sweet, floral davana and mouthwatering blackcurrant liqueur, igniting the senses and infusing the wearer with passionate energy. The heart of the fragrance reveals a sophisticated floral bouquet- luscious osmanthus, fresh magnolia, rich jasmine, all smoothed together with a warm, light vanilla that enchants us with its playful, yet complex, innocence. A base of wonderfully earthy patchouli, aromatic cade, woody papyrus and savory blond tobacco add richness and longevity without sacrificing an ounce of delightfully airy floral character. Presented in a beautifully iridescent yellow bottle, Sunshine couldn't be a more appropriate name- this is warm, sophisticated happiness in a fragrance, and we're honored to be one of the few select retailers on the planet to offer this joyful treasure."," Blackcurrant Liqueur, Almond, Davana, Osmanthus, Jasmine, Vanilla, Magnolia, Cade, Patchouli, Blond Tobacco, Papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41862.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lampblack Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," The sudden, eerily calm darkness before a ferocious storm. The hushed, electric silence when the lights cut out and the curtain has yet to rise. The colors and shapes that dance in front of our eyes when we wake in the middle of the night and try to focus in the pitch darkness. This is what Bruno Fazzolari has captured in Lampblack, last year's much-buzzed-over cult sensation. Inspired by the smell of India ink, this triumphantly exciting fragrance is transparent and earthy and colorful and wholly unique, and we couldn't be more thrilled to offer it to you. Lampblack opens with a bracing citrus note, sweet orange coming up against bitter grapefruit, with a nose-tingling, borderline metallic black pepper asserting itself and establishing an off-kilter modernism to the whole affair. As the inky cypriol and earthy vetiver take over, the air continues to crackle with anticipatory energy, revealing the hidden depths of the darkness that still envelops the fragrance. Dark yet colorful, simple yet intricate, Lampblack embraces its contradictions for a modern, boldly creative scent that isn't just noticeably unique, but also uniquely easy to wear."," Sweet Orange, Black Pepper, Bitter Grapefruit, Nagamotha, Benzoin, Vetiver, Shadow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Five Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," As the first of his perfumes to be featured in a gallery alongside his paintings, Bruno Fazzolari paired Five with“vivid and lively paintings in primary colors... lit by strong fluorescent lights.” One sniff of this brisk, crisply assertive citrus/herbal/woods fragrance and the association becomes clear. Five is almost a traditional cologne- bright, fresh, and vibrantly spiced- but like the otherworldly fluorescents casting their own character on a painting, there's something in the balance of the fragrance, and in the lightly mineralic touches, that forces one to see the whole thing slightly askew. Aromatic rosemary mingles with a heavy dose of petitgrain and a 'high altitude' accord to give a robustly ozonic characteristic, as if pure oxygen was pumping from Five's otherwise traditionally composed heart. Like the gallery lights set up to deliberately alter your perception of the painting, Five is the traditional cologne born anew."," Lemon, Red Mandarin, Bergamot, Neroli, Rosemary, Petitgrain, Sweet Woods, Mineral & Saltwater Notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tempted Muse Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," Inspired by mythical ambrosia, the dessert of the gods, Tempted Muse is an irresistible fruity nectar - as sweet and sensual as it is bright and innocent. Perfumer Tanja Bochnig envisioned a drowsy-eyed muse waking up on a sunny morning in a flower covered meadow, still ""drunken on nectar and love"",  considering stealing a kiss from her sleeping lover. Tempted Muse opens like a sunrise - sparkling and warm - with grapefruit, frangipani and tuberose. The sweet freshness is balanced with balmy white florals and rose in the heart; and deepened by honeyed tonka, vanilla and sandalwood in the base. Perhaps the flirtiest scent we've smelled from April Aromatics, and we're smitten."," Frangipani, tuberose, jasmine, rose otto, tonka bean, sandalwood, ylang ylang, pink grapefruit, vanilla, anis fruit accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65812.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Religieuse Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," At turns delicate and animalic, pure and carnal, jasmine is rightfully considered one of perfumery's most versatile and valued notes.  Both reverent and blasphemous, La Religieuse (”œthe nun”) uses its jasmine to paint a portrait of a woman in full, where sweet and comforting give way to hidden depths of animalic desire, and ultimately, to freedom. La Religieuse opens with a gourmand flourish, as the fresh, lightly green jasmine combines with sweet, sugared mimosa and smooth incense to evoke imagery of a saintly servant of god, pure in her devotion and intentions, bringing comfort and joy to those under her care. But as it evolves, and a more animalic civet note begins to coax out the other side of the jasmine, we realize that this woman has her own desires, her own fantasies, and her own yearning to escape the life that has been given to her. While the sweetness lingers, the incense now feels dirtier, the musk sexier. La Religieuse never goes fully down and dirty, but the transition is thrillingly palpable: our heroine, while she might never go completely wild, is no longer content to be anyone's silent bride. Once again, Serge Lutens has delivered us a gorgeous, encompassing fragrance that tells a story we won't soon forget."," Jasmine, incense, civet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Flash Parfum Extrait,Tauerville," While we've never had trouble getting excited about a new fragrance from Andy Tauer, we have to admit we weren't sure exactly what might make the first entry from Tauerville different from the flagship Tauer Perfumes we know and love. But then we tried the immaculately composed, surprisingly naturalistic Rose Flash, a fragrance quintessentially Andy Tauer in its reverence for both subject and wearer but made with an entirely different sort of artistic flourish, and we instantly understood. Whether you've loved everything he's ever made or not, or if you simply love a beautifully constructed rose scent, Rose Flash is not to be missed.As part of the grand Tauerville experiment, it is Mr. Tauer's wish not to list the notes, rather, to let the fragrance speak for itself. But what we can tell you is that Rose Flash is a tribute to the gorgeous fullness of a rose still growing- spicy, creamy, green, luscious, all aligned in a wonderful balance that never isolates any of these disparate elements but rather allows them to shine through together. An ambery woodsiness sings in concert with a perky burst of citron, keeping the lively and the swoon-worthy dancing in harmony, never eclipsing the very true rose notes that project with dignified strength and last for hours. We never bet against Andy Tauer, but even we didn't realize just how unique and compelling the Tauerville line could be. A must try.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bal D'Afrique Roll-on Oil Perfume Oil,BYREDO," Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent.  Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself.  A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupÃ§on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub – sweet and adorable, but it still has claws.  Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, african marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, moroccan cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64166.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gypsy Water Hair Perfume,BYREDO," BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented.This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy – strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire – golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top.  This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous."," Bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64168.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blanche Hair Perfume,BYREDO," BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented.An effortlessly lovely ode to the color white. Blanche opens with the crystalline sharpness of aldehydes, and then eases into a gentle white floral washed with soft sandalwood and transparent musk. Blanche is as light as a bubble floating on a warm summer wind and as clean as the steam from a long, hot shower. This is definitely in the family of freshly laundered scents, but it has a delicious warmth at its core that sets it apart. The ephemeral sweetness of the violet is anchored with the delectable milky richness of the sandalwood.  Blanche does not bring to mind harsh detergents or astringent cleansers, but rather the creamy lather of French-milled soap on clean, wet skin. As sheer and weightless as silk chiffon, you could wrap yourself in it and it would still read as delicate and airy. A classic and elegant rendering of the concept of“clean”, it balances the brisk, fresh elements with soft, sensual ones. Pure and beautiful."," White rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64169.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Laudano Nero Extrait de Parfum,Tiziana Terenzi," Paris on a rainy autumn day: warm rain beating on slate rooftops, stone streets lit by dim lights. A small fire at the crossroads of Montmartre heats musicians and acrobats, waiting for the tourists to return. The magical atmosphere is steeped in precious scents that echo this timeless place: an unusual explosion of absinthe-like camphor, a swell of rich labdanum and cognac, a strong vein of precious woods. Unobtainable resins reflect off the smell of slate and laurel, of wet road and smoky fire. Comforting, bohemian, beautiful: Laudano Nero is Paris in a bottle."," Wormwood, cognac, rosemary, tobacco, myrtle, amber, red rose, black locust honey, cedar, iris, sandalwood, ash, slate, cashmere musk, laurel, incense, camphor, agarwood, vetiver, oak, vanilla and labdanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kedu Eau de Parfum,MEMO," Kedu, nicknamed“the garden of Java” in Indonesia, is a plain bordered by a volcano. Its soil, which has been made fertile by the ash, is sacred. Glossy green palm trees nonchalantly rub shoulders with one-horned rhinoceros, giant flowers in changing colours, prehistoric buffalo and bent-backed pilgrims.Tradition has it that you can purify your soul by throwing sesame seeds – one seed for each passion – into one of the flaming domes. By capturing this unique ingredient alongside a beautifully vibrant grapefruit note, Kedu whisks us away to one of the world's most unique locations.Kedu opens with that grapefruit essence, tart, juicy and bright, fleshed out further with supporting notes of citrus and matÃ©. Peppery green freesia explodes like the heat of the volcano, warming the sesame for a composition both floral and fresh but with a toasted complexity. If the holy site of Kedu represents purification, then the fragrance is the moments thereafter: light, bright, vibrant and free."," Grapefruit, neroli, mandarin, matÃ© absolute, freesia, rose, peony, sesame absolute, white musk, moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"Silk, Lace & Chocolate Eau de Parfum",4160 Tuesdays," Originally created in 2015 as 4160 Tuesdays' limited edition Valentines fragrance, they sold out and brought it back due to popular demand. The brand had been planning a new chocolate scent for a while, and finally decided that this one was ready to come out to play. It has a delicate hint of strawberry too, and a touch of tart bergamot.It's made with cocoa absolute, such an intense chocolate scent that it almost knocks you down with pleasure. Try this instead of eating a chocolate bar."," Cocoa absolute, strawberry, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lalibela Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A place of pilgrimage and celebration, the ancient city of Lalibela in Ethiopa is known for its twelve stunning churches, hewn from solid rock in the 12th and 13th centuries. Now, MEMO and perfumer Alienor Massenet present this breathtakingly mysterious locale in a fragrance both mystifying and comforting, a full-bodied incense floral where Western ritual meets the delectably exotic, resulting in a fragrance that exists somewhere between earthly and divine- much like the city itself. Lalibela opens with a burst of patchouli-inflected spiciness and a compellingly mouthwatering coconut and orchid combination that feels as mystical as it does gourmand. A full-bodied rose adds to the spicy-smooth bouquet, while the incense walks the line between churchy and far-flung. To the pilgrims who have endured the grueling journey, their joyous fervor on reaching their holy destination can only be described as ecstatic. With Lalibela, MEMO delivers a similarly ecstatic experience- no pilgrimage necessary."," Coconut orchid, rose, jasmine absolute, Indonesian patchouli, rockrose, vanilla, tobacco, frankincense, labdanum resin.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shams Oud,MEMO," Legend has it that the Persian god Mithras climbs into his gold-covered chariot at dawn and whips his horses forward to pull the sun across the sky until dusk.  But then at nightfall, the sun is swallowed, only to return the following morning. With Shams Oud, MEMO celebrates this cycle of life, death and rebirth with a vibrantly spiced, intoxicatingly warm and woodsy fragrance that shines as bright as the sun itself.Shams Oud opens with a sunrise of pepper, ginger and saffron, dazzling with complexity and energy. As the sun rises higher in the sky, its warmth increases, represented here by cypriol, styrax, and a lovely, luminescent oud that showcases a facet often underrepresented- its potential for an almost narcotic, powdery woodsiness. With knockout sillage and a gorgeous, enveloping profile, Shams Oud will have you sniffing your wrist from now until the sun is ready to repeat its journey again tomorrow."," Pepper, rose, ginger, saffron, cypriol heart, cashmeran, tonka bean, tolu balsam absolute, styrax absolute, labdanum absolute, oud.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Granada Eau de Parfum,MEMO," A feminine white floral with hidden complexities, Granada is an ultra romantic, surprisingly sensual late night dance through the gardens of the Alhambra. Inspired by late evenings beneath the walls of the famed red castle, the nighttime air redolent with Andalusian jasmine, Granada seduces us with a lightly resinous mix of clean and dirty florals that balance purity and carnality with expert precision. Granada opens sweet and bright, with bergamot and African orange flower balancing atop a delightfully dry grenadine note. The jasmine emerges, first virginally clean, then lightly indolic, its transition smoothed with a hazy heliotrope. A delicately woodsy base of tonka, vanilla and musks gives longevity and swings the balance back towards sexiness. Like Spain itself, Granada proves itself complex enough to represent many different facets of beauty."," Oil of bergamot, pomegranate, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, hÃ©liotrope, musk, amber wood accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moon Fever,MEMO," Is Moon Fever the fragrance of an imaginary safari on the mysterious dark side of the moon, as MEMO's promotional concept suggests? Or does it perhaps simply represent the multitude of stars visible in the perpetual dusk of the Serengeti night, where the planet's most majestic wildlife stares up at the same brilliant tapestry that you do? Either way, there's only one word appropriate to describe the crisp depths of Moon Fever: luminous. Moon Fever draws you in with a crisp, full citrus opening, blending fresh juicy mandarin with tart grapefruit, bright lemon and a lovely bitter orange for a citrus blend that's unexpectedly cool and full-bodied. The lightly earthy heart of verbena, primrose, vetiver and sage gives an almost tea-like smoothness, keeping the enchanting contrast between the black night sky and the sparkling stars as an enrapturing tonka bean drydown connects earth to heaven. Once again, MEMO has given us a scent with the power not only to transport, but to inspire."," Bitter orange, grapefruit, primofiore lemon, neroli blossom absolute, clary sage, verbena, vetiver, leather, tonka bean absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Luxor Oud,MEMO," The gateway of Luxor is humanity's oldest prayer site, a place where time stands still on the banks of the Nile. Under the shade of the colossus Ramses II, roses and fruits grow wild amongst the temple stones. Luxor Oud presents this majestic, mystical place in all of its balance between the ancient and the natural, freshness and sensuality vibrating in harmony with deep, resinous wood. Luxor Oud's balance comes from the classic marriage of rose and oud; in this case, a lush mixture of rose absolute given juicy fullness from essence of mandarin. Against this backdrop, the marvelous oud accord- robust and full-bodied with not a hint of medicinal artificiality- exudes quiet power.  By recreating the harmony of a sacred place claimed equally by nature and the gods, Luxor Oud is another beautifully transportive fragrance from MEMO Paris."," Mandarin, red berries, rose, cypriol heart, rockrose absolute, patchouli, styrax resin, tonka bean, oud.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Irish Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"“It's one of those icy, biting mornings. The sun scarcely manages to break through the heavy grey clouds. The air is crisp and dry, and the wind slips beneath my clothes. The North wind whips the grass that sticks to my boots. I walk into the stable and swing open the wooden tack room doors, freeing the burning scent of leather, wood, amber and honey. Its age-old odor stands out sharply in the frozen morning air. My horse whinnies softly. It's the smell of her freedom. The leather gathers in the wind, the grass warms with the wood. Irish Leather gallops off into the horizon.”MEMO co-founder John Molloy is understandably proud of his rural Irish upbringing, and Irish Leather, the first of MEMO's Cuirs Nomades series, positively sings of Ireland's rustic beauty. Opening notes of juniper, pink pepper and clary sage whisk us away to the wild countryside, while the leather- sharp, well-worn and deeply animalic- gives us the barn, the saddle and the horse all at once. Comforting yet forlorn, stark yet vibrantly beautiful, Irish Leather is among the most wonderfully wearable leathers we've ever experienced."," Pink pepper, clary sage, juniper berry, green matÃ© absolute, flouve, iris concrete, tonka bean absolute, leather, birch, amber accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Italian Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," The smell of leather can represent so much in Italian culture, from a couture jacket to ancient Roman armor. But for the Italian edition of their Cuirs Nomades series, MEMO and Alienor Massenet chose the ultimate depiction of the quintessentially Italian la bella vita- the leather-wrapped steering wheel of a top-down cabriolet hugging the curves on a coastal highway, young lovers tucked into the seats, hair whipping in the countryside-scented wind, a sumptuous picnic packed into a basket in the backseat. The first impressions of Italian Leather are fresh and green: tomato leaf and soft, lightly herbal vanilla, accompanied by a sharp, young leather that invigorates. As the leather matures and mixes with orris root and resinous galbanum, the warm, spicy outdoorsy qualities give off a hint of motor oil and coastal air, leaving us relaxed and excited all at once. Italians, as they say, are the French in a good mood- and one sniff of Italian Leather is bound to put you in a good mood all your own."," Green tomato leaf, vanilla, leather, rockrose absolute, galbanum, clary sage, iris concrete, vanilla bean absolute, sandalwood, tolu balsam resin, opoponax resin, myrrh resin, benzoin resin, leather accord, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
French Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO," The essence of French style lies not in wild extravagance or gauche flights of fantasy, but in the deceptively casual, elegant everyday fashion that exudes the wordly, confident sensuality that Parisians are known for. With French Leather, MEMO delivers a leather fragrance that feels quintessentially Parisian- luscious suede and elegant rose combining in a gently charming concoction made all the more irresistible by its everyday accessibility.   Like the effortless style of a true Parisian, French Leather accentuates the comfortable with the bold, in this case focusing on a butter-soft suede accord that comes to life with exquisitely rationed bursts of color- bright, vibrant lime, lively pink pepper and juniper, and rich, sensual rose. The result is sheer loveliness, the sort of lived-in elegance that projects comfort and confidence in equal measure. For the ingÃ©nue who never wants to be seen as trying too hard, French Leather is your new secret weapon."," Lime, pink pepper, juniper, rose, clary sage, cedar, styrax resin, vetiver, musk, suede accord.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pomelo Paradis Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," The Pomelo may look like a jumbo-sized grapefruit, but don't mistake the two. They're actually distant cousins that share very little in common. Beneath the pomelo's bitter, bright green peel lies a pink fruit with the sweetness of an orange. Though pomelos have been loved in Southeast Asia for ages, they've only recently gained popularity in western groceries.Pomelo Paradis is Atelier Cologne's 7th cologne absolue in their Collection Originale, and is an homage to this unsung citrus. With one of the most mouthwatering openings we've ever smelled, Pomelo Paradis serves up both the crisp edginess of the peel with all the sweetness of its fruit; like the moment of pulling apart the juicy segments, with the peel just removed, not yet discarded.Pomelo Paradis sustains its crisp, sweet freshness by surrounding Floridian pink pomelo with heart notes of the highest quality -  tangy black currant bud, sweet Calabrian mandarin, Moroccan orange blossom, Bulgarian rose and Chinese mint.  Its base of Haitian Vetiver, Tuscan Iris and amber leave you with an elegant, velvety dry down. If you're a fan of fresh, bright and happy citrus, you will love Pomelo Paradis."," Pink grapefruit, Calabrian mandarin, black currant, orange blossom, Bulgarian rose, mint, amber, vetiver and iris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Debaser Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent,  Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail,  the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser,  named after the band's 1989 hit,  is not a typically creamy,  lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright,  hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic,  warm,  bold and woody fig.Debaser's refrain,  ""I am un chien andalusia, "" is a nod to the title of Luis BuÃ±uel and Salvador DalÃ­'s classic surrealist film. Black Francis said of BuÃ±uel,  ""I wish BuÃ±uel were still alive. He made this film about nothing in particular. The title itself is a nonsense."" D.S. and Durga's Debaser is therefor a tribute to a song about a film about ""nothing in particular."" And fittingly,  it's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown,  when it sheds the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris,  coconut,  tonka and moss -  leave a cool,  velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive."," Bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freetrapper Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," D.S. & Durga's Freetrapper distills a rugged landscape of rivers and tangled trees through sharp citrus and a sweet, warm shadow of cedar. It evokes the free-spirited trappers, traders, and mountain men who roamed the Rockies, living with the elements when trading in beaver pelts was necessary business, when the beaver (castor canendensis) was hunted for its fur and valuable musk. Freetrapper's heart notes of light, smoky incense encircles the bracing green citrus; like smoke on the horizon with the crush of faded greens underfoot on a trapper's weary trek homeward. It's the crisp yet animalic scent of wild dangerous times - of  loners, lawbreakers, vagabond merchants crisscrossing dense, aromatic and desolate wilds to make money, settle land, love local women and die with their beaver boots on."," Distilled incense, bergamot, bitter orange, dark cedar, snakeroot, osmanthus, amberwood, santal, and castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Burning Barbershop Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," In 1891, Westlake NY, a bottle of blackened cologne survived a conflagration that burned the Curling Bros. barbershop to the ground. Charred, reduced and dark, this scorched blend of vintage gentlemanly notes has been vividly re-created by David Moltz in all its pungent, roasted glory. The resonance and reach of Burning Barbershop is quite magnificent; a sweet rubbed spearmint note mixed with offbeat salted lime creates wonderful fumes of nostalgia. Everything smells baked and piquant. Lavender is a beautiful rich addition, smoky, hot and sugared, crumbled across the embers of the cologne's base notes. It is scent for flesh, not for paper and abstract wanderings. You might miss the most amazing soft-shoed vanilla as it dances softy in the smoke, tempering the excesses of bitter citrus and metallic pyrotechnics. A black, rubber whiff of night pervades the drydown, as if the skin is releasing soot into a starless sky. A scent of darkened wonderment."," Spearmint, lime, hemlock spruce, lavender absolute, turkish rose, burnt oil, vanilla, and hay.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bowmakers Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," If you can imagine a workshop, lit by oil lamps and a brace of flickering candles, wax dripping to the floor. Everywhere is wood, maple, mahogany, chips of darkest ebony, floor littered in fragrant curled shavings, the air filled with lacquered dust and the aromatics of a thousand sweet pencils. A man bends over an oak bench, tending to the curved form of a violin, the body warm and golden in the soft light, its neck, pegs and tailpiece scattered under his nimble fingers. Puffs of pine resin drift as he works, smoothing, gluing and attending to the preparation of varnishes and oils to give ornate lustre to grain and line. This is D.S & Durga's Bowmakers, an astonishing time capsule evocation of violin and bow making workshops in 18th century American pioneer towns. Each workshop concocted their own secret recipe for the decorative shellacs and lacquers. These might contain elemi, benzoin, saffron, mastic, sandalwood and turpentine for color, preservation, finish, tone and beauty.  D.S.& Durga have brought this polished, resinous portrait of craftsmen to life in an affecting and vibrantly glowing scent."," Violin varnish, mahogany, outdoors accord, amber pine resin, maplewood, cypress, spiced tree resin, cedar, and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Coriander Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Coriander is perhaps one of the most inscrutable and left-field aromas in the D.S. & Durga canon. It is sparklingly green, but also a dry peppery herbal, and at the same time a delicate aquatic floral musk. Coriander defies easy classification. But where is the fun is labeling anyway? It might be the subtle, unexpected salinity that makes this scent such an enigma, that sea breeze drifting through the formula, deftly weaving pepper, juniper, geranium, magnolia, musk and mace around the heart of Ukrainian coriander.  As it unfolds on the skin it evokes a warm summer breeze off the Black Sea, rolling up the hills above Odessa. It's a light, fresh, energetic green."," Russian coriander, pepper, juniper needle, geranium, clove stem, clary sage, musk, magnolia, and mace.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cowboy Grass Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Still as a silvered sunset on a dry summer's eve, Cowboy Grass crackles with quiet urgency across the skin. Parched and desolate, the sagebrush awaits the fire. The scent teeters on the edge of ignition, but seems somehow to hold back, soothed perhaps by a sense of latent moisture in the air, brushing through the flowering white thyme and prairie switchgrass. The rooty majesty of vetiver is one of perfumery's most vital and transcendent notes, the full flavor secreted away in the rhizome of Chrysopogon zizanioides which is harvested, hung and dried like precious game. Cowboy Grass is lit through with Haitian vetiver, known for its sweeter, smokier tones. The fragrance settles into a calming rhythmic aridity, vast and mysterious. We see the hands of Christina Olson in Wyeth's iconic 1948 painting planted firmly in the grass as she looks up at that distant haunting grey house. One of the most skeletal depictions of landscape in scent, Cowboy Grass is a quiet masterpiece, a poignant scent of hush and privacy."," Rosewood, wild thyme, bergamot, sagebrush, basil, rose otto, vetyver, grass, and ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Italian Citrus Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Any D.S. & Durga take on citrus notes will intrigue the senses and warm the blood. This is balmy sprawled afternoons under parasols, tugged gently by summer winds, books and neglected papers scattered softly in the temperate shade. The scent of citrus trees drifts by like a reminder of seasons lived and loved. There is so much depth to Italian Citrus, a balsamic, rounded fervor rare in this family of effervescent fleeting aromas. Designed traditionally to refresh and whet our olfactory edge, citrus scents use sparkle, zing and sherbet to widen our senses and awaken the torpid soul. This oddly powdered scent with its hints of sticky Campari and candied peel fuses traditional zest and peel with smoke and sweet animalics for an incredibly sophisticated patina of cocktail poise. Hours into the drydown Italian Citrus is an exercise in clean, tender classicism."," Cold pressed lemon, chinotto, blood orange, green mandarin, violet leaf, incense, copaiba balsam, musk ambrette, and oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mississippi Medicine Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga," Tribal pyres burning in the forests, with smoke from pine, holly, cypress, laurel, and cedar rising upwards to the gods.  D.S.& Durga looked to the funerary rituals of the early Mississippian Death Cult, the loosely connected network of tribes in America's regions around the 1200 AD, as the inspirations for the haunting yet comfortingly earthy Mississippi Medicine.Mississippi Medicine opens with herbal, woody top notes of freshly gathered juniper branches, twigs, lichen-clad bark, and sweet grassy violet - damp, cool, and dense with a stunning realism. Birch tar emerges like smoke mingling up through the wood and herbs of the pyre before it is consumed in flames. As the birch smoke floats above the skin in wafts of muted, spectral, gray in the scent's unfolding, the base of dry cedar and frankincense grows stronger. And in the final dry down all that remains is that incense and the woody embers, like the ash that was left after the pyres died down; after the smoke had reached the gods above and only the cinders remain to be covered and buried back into the soil."," Red cedar, aldehydes, frankincense distillate, cypress root, black pine, cascarilla bark, incense, spanish cade, and birch tar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
A La Rose Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Ã€ la rose is a declaration of love for all women captured in a fragrance. Queen of flowers, the rose knows no boundaries and has inspired those in the creative arts for centuries. Poets, painters, musicians... and perfumers alike. All have sought to capture its aura, its magic and its secrets.Two varieties of rose have bestowed the radiance and richness of their petals on this Eau de parfum: two hundred and fifty Centifolia roses from Grasse (May Rose) in the form of an absolute produce a very floral base note with sweet honeyed and carnal accents. One hundred and fifty Damascena roses from Bulgaria in the form of an essential oil create a top note with a playful blend of pear and lychee. Ã€ la rose has the crisp tenderness of rose petals, a whimsical free-spirited style and an elegance that radiates femininity."," Damascena rose, bergamot, orange, violet, magnolia blossom, cedar, musk, Centifolia rose.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49839.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Oriental Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," A Palais Royal exclusive, released for export for a limited time only, Vetiver Oriental is a completely unique interpretation of vetiver, as original as we came to expect from Lutens. Rich and striking, Vetiver Oriental enthralls us with its luxuriously balsamic accents of benzoin and labdanum. Moving from the brighter, more aromatic vetiver of the top notes, highlighted by the greens and the earthy chilliness of iris, the fragrance darkens considerably. The heart is a nocturnal, sultry brew of spicy gaiac wood and vetiver, a deep, exceptionally luxurious accord, which underscores the velvety depth of the vetiver by including a chocolate note. The union of the earthy, resinous notes and the dark, bitter chocolate is breathtakingly beautiful. Enriched further by the opulent base notes of soft musk, golden amber, sweet  sandalwood and warm, silky-smooth labdanum, the scent wows us with its exceptional luxuriousness, its mysterious beauty and proves once and for all that where the woody oriental perfumes are concerned, Lutens has no equals."," Sap, iris pallida, undergrowth notes, vetiver, gaiac wood, chocolate, musk, amber, mosses, sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Empressa Eau de Toilette,Penhaligons," As the British Empire expanded to the corners of the map in the 19th century, so, too, did the world of luxurious items available to delight the wealthy and adorn the powerful. As the most elegantly feminine of Penhaligon's new Trade Routes Collection, Empressa is a testament to the silks, baubles and delicacies then available to only a lucky few- those most exotic of imports that gave rise to the luxury goods we covet to this day. Empressa's opening shimmers with bright pink pepper, succulent blood orange, dewberry, and a juicy, mouthwatering peach note. The heart is richly floral, lustrous with the dusky pinks and soft whites of rose and neroli, evoking smooth silks and luminous jewels. A sensuous drydown of patchouli and vanilla is sweetened by a blend of cocoa, amber and caramel-like maltol, with warm cedar and rich sandalwood giving depth and authority. Like the eye-catching treasures of the Victorian elite, the wearable elegance of Empressa will immediately mark you as someone who deserves- and receives- only the finest things in life."," Blood Orange, Bergamot, Mandarin, Peach, Cassis, Dewberry, Rose, Neroli, Geranium, Cardamom, Pink Pepper, Black Pepper, Vanilla Pod, Cocoa, Frankincense, Amber, Musk, Woods, Patchouli, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44157.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Erdenstern Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics," It might not seem like a compliment to say that a fragrance reminds you of a rainy day, but in the case of Erdenstern, the latest all-natural stunner from April Aromatics, we mean it as high praise. Of course, we're not talking about some ordinary rainy day- Erdenstern is more like a warm, gentle rain in a mist-shrouded meadow, an earthy, musky meditation with an almost spiritual power to uplift and inspire reflection.Erdenstern (”œEarth Star”) takes its inspiration from Avalon, the Arthurian holy place between the worlds of gods and mortals, so it's only natural that the fragrance is elevated and ethereal, linking wet, earthy vetiver to a heavenly, incense-tinged botanical musk accord that melds the sensual with the spiritual. A restrained touch of sweetness from opoponax and tobacco protect against solemnity, while an unprecedented botanical ambergris accord is stunning in its delicate complexity. Tanja Bochnig has long impressed us with her gift for creating fragrances that embrace their all-natural ingredients as an asset and an identity. But as good as each and every offering from April Aromatics has been, Erdenstern, with its deep well of gentle beauty and genuine wisdom, might be her best yet."," Botanical musk accord, botanical ambergris accord, tonka bean, vetiver, tabak, cacao, opoponax.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65811.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tagete Eau de Parfum,Profumum," The scent of a courtyard garden in Amalfi is, of course, far more than just the garden itself. On Italy's postcard-perfect Mediterranean coast, the lush, dewy florals of a carefully cultivated garden blend seamlessly into the ambient fragrance of the terroir: the wild plants, the mossy trees, the ocean itself. Breathtakingly, authentically beautiful, Tagete is an opportunity to visit one of the most peaceful locales on the planet- no matter where you might be.Tagete opens in a fresh, lovely burst of flowers, both wild and cultivated- rich, honey-sweet marigold, full-bodied jasmine, and the creamy, lively tuberose that Profumum perfected in their Tuberosa. A delicately earthy vetiver adds depth, while a damp, fresh moss bridges the gap between sea and earth. The overall effect is meditative, a stolen moment of reflection and appreciation. You've heard of a vacation in a bottle, but this is something more than that- call it genuine, beautiful tranquility."," Marigold, jasmine, tuberose, vetiver, moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33939.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kashan Rose Eau de Toilette,The Different Company," The Different Company's L'Esprit Cologne series has consistently reinvigorated an often narrowly defined category with fresh, light scents that still manage to showcase sophisticated ingredients with surprising sillage and longevity. Kashan Rose, the latest in the line, accomplishes this with distinction, delivering a bright, cheerful, lightly spicy rose of unexpected sophistication and depth that's as effortlessly attractive as it is easy to wear. Kashan Rose opens with a tingly sparkle of pink pepper, given fruity depth from litchi and an herbaceous hum of cardamom and sage. The rose that emerges, named for a Persian city famous for its annual Rose Festival, is fresh, green and uplifting, projecting a natural, full-bodied rose that never gets heavy or cloying. And despite the exquisite lightness of the rose note, it lingers for hours, supported by a sheer, musky base of ambrette and hawthorn. Fresh and delicate, yet modern and long-lasting, this is a rose you could wear every single day."," Sage, litchi, pink pepper, cardamom, Persian rose, hawthorn, peony, ambrette, sandalwood, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25338.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Egypt Eau de Toilette,Eight and Bob," Although Albert Fouquet is best remembered for creating Eight & Bob's distinct flagship scent (and captivating one John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the process), his olfactory adventures did not begin and end there. Egypt, one of two stunning new fragrances rediscovered from Fouquet's private collection, is a testament to Fouquet's enduring legacy, a subtle, sophisticated and remarkably fresh woody eau de parfum inspired by (and conceived during) two sightseeing trips through one of the world's most fascinating, culturally rich countries. Based on the exotic plants and flowers Fouquet found in the gardens of his Egyptian friend during his visit, Egypt opens with a crisp, understated mixture of citrus, lavender and moss, calling to mind leisurely mornings in sunny courtyards with good company. The heart of the fragrance is rich with Egyptian spices- cardamom and nutmeg- and a quietly robust base of leather, patchouli and sandalwood confers regal elegance without ever overpowering. Subtle yet vibrant, spicy yet soft, Egypt is the perfect fragrance for the worldly gentleman who knows when less is more."," Lavender, Moss, Lemon, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cap d'Antibes Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," Sailing in the picturesque waters of the Grande Bleue, taking in a golden sunset from the gardens of the Eden Roc, enjoying a cocktail in the refined company of European aristocracy: summer on the French Riviera in the 1930s was the kind of glamorous existence that simply has no equal in contemporary society. For Albert Fouquet, it was the very pinnacle of life, one he was inspired to capture in a fragrance that might help chase away the doldrums of the cold Parisian winter. The resulting fragrance was Cap D'Antibes, an enveloping, sophisticated fougÃ¨re that was exclusive to Fouquet's private collection- until now. Cap D'Antibes immediately whisks you to the sun-kissed cobblestones of the south of France with a bright, sparkling opening of sweet violet, cool mint, and lightly resinous birch. The heart of the fragrance further invigorates, with cinnamon, moss, and a regional aromatic accord evoke fresh evening breezes and elegant cocktail parties. In the drydown, warm incense and delicate cedar intertwine with a perfect touch of relaxing vanilla. We may never see a time and place that can quite equal the glamour of Albert Fouquet's beloved Antibes. Luckily, he left us a perfect way to pay it a visit, wherever we may be."," mint, violet leaf, birch, cinnamon, moss, green notes, cedar, incense and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ombre Indigo Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," A voluptuous and smokey fragrance, Ombre Indigo is the scent of shadow. Ombre Indigo is an enigmatic fragrance; its blend of woods and smoked resins reveals the radiant opulence of tuberose laced with saffron and melts into swirls of papyrus, incense and benzoin. A bright, deep, beguiling and flamboyant sillage.Brazilian photographer Gustavo Pellizzon brings out the beauty of shadows; his image Ombre Indigo (a print is included in the box) is a tribute to grace. This serene, relaxed man seems to have waltzed with the sun. He carried on his shoulders the firepower of stars and now surrenders to the indigo wave that brings the gentleness of sunset. His adventure is fragrantly extreme. His power is serene. He embraces the shadow and stays in that serene and inviting space where people share secrets and bond with each other. An oasis and a secret place where anything is possible: dreams of flying to the sky or diving into the deep-sea where everything is movement and immutability; a meditation that is at once transcendental and equanimous."," Petit-grain bigarade absolute, tuberose, saffron, plum, vetiver essence, papyrus essence, leather, incense, benzoin resin, amber, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Cuba Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Why name a fragrance Cuir Cuba Intense when a standard“Cuir Cuba” doesn't even exist? One sniff of Patricia de Nicolai's stunningly complex new tobacco and leather scent should clear that question up. Rich, spicy, floral and animalic, Cuir Cuba Intense is such a gorgeously constructed head-turner that a more modest name would have felt like an understatement.Inspired by Mme de Nicolai's early memories of the family humidor, Cuir Cuba Intense opens with a nostalgic burst of lemon, mint and licorice, brisk and herbaceous, which conjures the wonders and pleasures of childhood. As the centerpiece tobacco leaf accord unfolds, smooth and musky, it's embraced by a soft floral bouquet and gourmand spice notes of cumin and coriander. The dry down reveals further amber/leather warmth and smoothness, blending seamlessly with the heart notes until making way for a sexy, animalic hay-and-civet final phase. Vivid, complex and richly comforting, Cuir Cuba Intense is the kind of unique, compelling fragrance that words can't do justice- you'll have to experience it for yourself."," Sicilian lemon, star anise, licorice, mint, lavender, geranium, ylang ylang, magnolia, coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, tobacco, hay, liatris, and civet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31351.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Land of Warriors Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," In the storybook world of The Vagabond Prince, our heroes are classic archetypes: noble monarchs, comely damsels, and, in the case of Land of Warriors, honorable yet ferocious adventurers clad head to toe in that most rugged of all materials- leather. In fact, Bertrand Duchaufour has stunned us yet again with his inventiveness, gifting Land of Warriors with a unique vertical blend of leather accords that emerge across every stage of the fragrance, paying tribute to multiple facets of this versatile, powerful material.We follow the leather in Land of Warriors through its impressively distinct phases, beginning with top notes of vegetal leather: violet leaf, cucumber accord and blackcurrant open fresh, tart and green. Before long, we encounter leather again, now in a more spicy, mineral state: syrupy davana and cistus absolute serve as a backdrop for oakwood, saffron and nutmeg, forming central notes that project with a refined but undeniable strength. As the more animalic facets of leather emerge in the form of castoreum, strength shares space with sensuality. Finally, the battle won, the warrior relaxes by the evening campfire, where the final smoky leather effect of styrax and tar swirls into an intoxicating base. A true gem of a leather scent, for warriors and modern-day heroes alike."," Angelique seed, violet leaf, cucumber accord, tomato leaf, blackcurrant leaf, oakwood, frankincense, davana, cistus absolute, saffron, nutmeg, oregano, castoreum absolute, ambergris accord, styrax, tar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Swan Princess Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," As the old European fairy tale goes, a princess was turned into a beautiful white swan so resplendent in her plumage that anyone who touched her feathers was compelled to follow her wherever she went. Built around a lavish cocoon of six beautifully distinct musks, Swan Princess proves itself worthy of its namesake, delivering an enchantingly soft musky-floral that instantly puts you under its spell. As if first seeing the titular Swan from a distance, your first impressions of Swan Princess are sheer whiteness- sparkling clean aldehydes and crisp, fresh citrus, with only the tiniest zing of pink pepper for contrast. As the softness of the indulgently muscenone-laden base begins to emerge, it gently twists around a lusciously floral heart, led by notes of iris, rose and jasmine. The result is extraordinary- fresh, utterly natural flowers that float seamlessly into one another, every possible rough edge polished smooth by the gorgeous musk blend. Breathtakingly soft, achingly beautiful- Swan Princess is pure magic."," Pink pepper, aldehydes, fresh citrus accord, bergamot, jasmine, a touch of gardenia, lily of the valley, mimosa, iris, rose, peony, six different musks, sandalwood, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violettes du Czar Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Of the many honors bestowed upon the legendary perfumers of France, only Oriza L. Legrand was ever given the title of“Purveyor to the Russian Court.” As the standout fragrance from the ensuing royal collection, Violettes du Czar caused a sensation across the Courts of Europe, thrilling the men and women noble enough to wear it with its audacious fortitude. Now, Oriza L. Legrand has brought back this classic fragrance, and we're delighted to report that this violet-and-leather stunner is every bit as head-turning as it must have been 100 years ago. Much of Violettes du Czars' distinctive character comes, unsurprisingly, from the violets- specifically, the distinguished violets found in the south of France. Violettes du Czar showcases these prized flowers in all of their complexity, opening with the energizing sharpness of green violet leaves and earthy wild violet flowers before the sophisticated, lightly woody sweetness of the prized violets of Nice takes center stage in the heart, supported by iris and heliotrope. A virile yet silk-smooth accord of Russian leather anchors the base, adding power without sacrificing an ounce of sophistication. The days of the czar may be long gone, but his royal fragrance is back and better than ever."," Violet leaves, wild violet, violet from Nice, iris, heliotrope, tolu balm, leather, amber, and gaiac wood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Heliotrope Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," In the last 100 or so years, the heliotrope has been selectively bred to maximize its striking purple color, often sadly at the expense of its powerful, distinctive scent. How fortunate, therefore, that Heliotrope Blanc, created in 1886, honors the history of the flower by keeping the gorgeous vanilla-and-almond characteristics of heliotrope front and center. As a result, Heliotrope Blanc isn't just a fresh, elegantly blended floral with light gourmand touches- like all Oriza L. Legrand masterpieces, it's also a trip back through history. An exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level of this beautiful scent, opening alongside crisp violet leaves and orange blossom. In the heart, almond and mimosa draw out the heliotrope's indulgent side, drawing out the gourmand aspects of the flower while a sparkling iris keeps everything light and sheer. As Heliotrope Blanc dries down, musk and powder elements radiate softly, projecting timeless elegance. Not every heliotrope flower may smell as wonderfully as they used to, but as long as Oriza L. Legrand is around, we're happy knowing we can still get a gorgeous dose of the past."," Orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Myrrh Casati Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Inspired by Marchesa Casati, the legendary patron of the arts and muse of eccentricity, known for her extravagant dark fashion and lavish fetes replete with exotic animals, gilded servants, and an infectious waft of incense and mystery that surrounded her.Myrrh Casati casts a sharp spell with its concentrated top notes of spicy Peruvian red berries and pink pepper. We are swept into the heart and star of the fragrance, dark myrrh enrapt in richly herbal bittersweet notes of licorice, cardamom and safron. Incense, sweet benzoin and heady patchouli rise and dip into exotic smoky guaiac wood and earthy cypriol oil. Myrrh Casati, with its Monaesque complexity and originality, is strikingly alluring and obsessively addictive."," Peruvian red berries, pink pepper, Guatemalan cardamom, safron, licorice, Siamese benzoin, myrrh and incense from Somalia, Indonesian patchouli, Indian cypriol nagarmotha, guaiac wood from Paraguay.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51726.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
03. Apr. 1968 Eau de Parfum,Rundholz Parfums," The ethereal properties of incense have inspired ritual and spiritual fascination in disparate cultures across the globe since the early beginnings of civilization. From the austere resins of Roman Catholic incense to the tartness of Indian Ayurvedic blends, it's a material with endless facets but a single, deeply mystical, heart. This is the foundation upon which German designer Lenka Rundholz commissioned Rundholz 03. Apr. 1968, a fragrance intended not merely to capture a single aspect of incense, but to represent that most cherished substance in its totality. The result, delivered masterfully by Arturetto Landi, is stunning: an utterly unique blend of incenses at once wise and playful, sexy and welcoming, with an individuality of spirit that immediately announces the wearer as one who would prefer to set trends rather than follow them. A juicy lychee note provides unexpected fruitiness at the top, making a bold, fashionable statement, while a heart of heliotrope gives a softly savory complexity to the heart. The incense, meanwhile, is the undeniable star of the show- every facet of this magical substance, from dry to rich to sultry, weaves in and out from one another to create a scent that continues to delight as it lingers on the skin for hours. As Rundholz has said, the moment-to-moment unpredictability is precisely the point- this gorgeous fragrance will manage to surprise you long after you've fallen in love with it."," Lychee, heliotrope, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nuit Noire Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Dirty, dark and delicious, Mona di Orio's Nuit Noire is a throwback to perfumes worn by women who didn't work in offices, but rather used their scents to perfume fur, cigarettes... or other unmentionables.Nuit Noire starts with a surprisingly raunchy opening that combines cardamom and ginger with orange flower in a way that brings out the not-so-innocent orange flower's ripe-dirty side. From the beginning, Nuit Noire announces this perfume's rating: R, with a nod to triple-X. Incense and cinnamon-clove spices combined with the carnal tuberose then dries down, ”” if you can take it! ””  to a barnyard-y animalic dirtiness from leather and musk, no doubt with some sandalwood lurking around in the background.Although Mona di Orio's press materials asks us to imagine we're in“The souks, gardens, and hams of old Tunis” (of course Nuit Noire's notes reference old Arabia), Nuit Noire's soul is decidedly Film Noir: erotic and dangerous."," Orange flower, cardamom, ginger, orange guinee, olibanum, cinnamon, tuberose, sandalwood, clove, cedarwood, amber, leather, musk, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lux Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Like a chiaroscuro painting that contrasts extreme light with dark shadows, Mona di Orio's Lux (Latin for light) plays with an olfactory palette of light and dark. Lux starts off with a sparkling, sweet, and citrusy burst of Sicilian lemon and a lemongrass note from the Litsea cubeba, a tree in the evergreen family that is found in parts of Asia. This bright sweetness is tempered by the bitter-green herb note petitgrain signaling that, in spite of its name, Lux has more than a one-track mind.Darker tones of amber, benzoin, labdanum and vanilla add a creamy, heavier mood to Lux, while vetiver, cedar and sandalwood add texture and woods. While Lux's bright notes can still be felt in the drydown, an almost gourmand darkness takes over. To Lux's warmth and creaminess, di Orio adds another surprise as Lux takes on an unexpected dimension: an animalic drydown that lists musk in the notes, but that smells like civet to the nose.Like a walk in the woods as the day's light dims and the animal mystery of the forest is released, Lux's transformation is an olfactory wonder to behold."," Sicilian lemon, Litsea cubeba, petitgrain Bigarade South Africa, Haitian vetiver, Moroccan cedarwood, Mysore Sandalwood, Musk, amber, Siamese benzoin, bourbon vanilla and cistus labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lys Noir Eau de Parfum,Isabey," The original edition of Lys Noir made its debut in 1924, the height of the glamorous anÃ©es folles, where its mysterious elegance and chic art deco design elements made it an instant hit among the fearless, trendsetting women that came to define the era. Now, 90 years later, the house of Isabey is again on the rise, and to celebrate the onset of their 10th decade, Lys Noir has been resurrected and updated for the modern market. We are delighted to confirm that this seductive, opulent woody floral fragrance is as perfect for the sophisticated femme fatale of today as it would have been all those years ago.As the name suggests, Lys Noir is built around the captivating, narcotic flower of the lily, which is accompanied at the opening with an invigoratingly spicy burst of black pepper. As the rest of the heady, deeply floral bouquet emerges- animalic tuberose, spicy narcissus- Lys Noir envelops us completely, drawing us further and further under its spell not with raw volume but with the sophistication and seductive appeal of its composition. A darkly attractive base of smooth patchouli, powerful ebony and milky sandalwood maintains a perfect harmony between beauty and complexity- just like the dynamic women for whom this fragrance is perfectly suited. An exquisite and stylish black lacquered act-deco bottle and elegant coffret true to the original specifications complete the timeless aesthetic, ensuring that Lys Noir is a gem ideally suited to every collection."," Black pepper, lily, tuberose, heliotrope, narcissus, ebony, sandalwood, patchouli, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Doe in the Snow Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," The beauty of Sarah McCartney's playful, inventive creations lies in the specificity by which they're often created- inspired as she is by unique people, stories and requests, her scents are often more than a little out there- but they're never boring. Doe in the Snow, created for a customer's wintertime wedding, had a seemingly conflicting mission statement- make a big, fruity, mossy ”˜60s/”˜70s-style chypre, but make it ”˜cold.' The results are striking- ”˜citrus fruits, flowers and woods, stirred with an icicle.” There's plenty of brightness from the grapefruit, yuzu and cedrat, but the cool, mossy leather notes and the sparkle of the aldehydes give a crisp chilliness to the light that feels like the sun rising across a frozen lake. Do you love the profile of big, vintage fragrances, but are uncomfortable with the idea of your scent entering the room before you do? Doe in the Snow lets you have it both ways. Graceful, yet practical, it's the casually opulent scent you never realized you needed."," Grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64612.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tart's Knicker Drawer Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"“One day in the lab we were filtering six different fragrances at once. I tweeted,“I'm about to get in the E3 bus smelling like a tart's boudoir”. The replies came back,“You should make it!”“I'd like to smell that one”“Can I buy some?” so the next day, I sat down and blended some versions of all six.“It may have come to pass from an off-color joke, but as with most of Sarah McCartney's more spontaneous sources of inspiration, the end results more than justify the concept. Tart's Knicker Drawer, despite the name, is anything but overloaded- in fact, it presents the sophisticated, immaculately assembled feel of an elegant woman of the 1950s- fitted waist, hat, heels, perfect makeup, and full-bodied, expensive perfume.  In other words, while there's plenty of notes (as one might suspect from such a blend-intensive fragrance!), the result is both cohesive and surprisingly easy to wear. Indeed, Tart's Knicker Drawer wears its tongue-in-cheek moniker as a badge of pride, reveling in the thick cloud of big, powdery florals and spices and musky, rich base notes with a seductive confidence. If you're the type of person who can tell someone that you're wearing a fragrance named Tart's Knicker Drawer, then you're also the type who can pull off something this big, beautiful and fun."," Bergamot, orange, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, raspberry, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood, violet, tuberose, gaiacwood, amber, musk, vanilla, benzoin, tobacco.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64613.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Hoba Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," A fragrance doesn't necessarily have to be a gourmand in order to make you smell good enough to eat. That was our first thought after trying Red Hoba, a rich, exquisitely spiced addition to Xerjoff's Shooting Stars collection that blends intensely smoky notes with growling animalic ones, and yet arrives at a result both thrilling and, yes, mouthwatering. Like a meal with a groundbreaking Michelin-starred chef, you may not understand how the flavors come together when you're reading the menu, but you certainly will once you try the results. Red Hoba opens with an almost-Christmas-y cinnamon and cardamom that dance on the skin and balance the floral and fruity nuances of a full-bodied bergamot. Warm orris, jasmine and patchouli swirl in harmony with gentle incense, but as the base emerges, a fiercely sexy mix of labdanum and castoreum mingle with a soft, comforting musk and a delicate gaiac wood. What category does Red Hoba fall into? One sniff, and we promise you won't care."," Bergamot, cinnamon, cardamom, jasmine, orris, incense, patchouli, cashmeran, guaiac wood, labdanum, papyrus, musk and castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51138.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blue Hope Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Conventional wisdom says that cool fragrances can't be passionate and gourmands must be sickly sweet. We're glad nobody told Xerjoff that, because Blue Hope, the newest Shooting Star, is a tantalizingly complex stunner that combines fresh citrus and delicate spices with a delectably sexy vanilla-based drydown. Blue Hope announces its year-round wearability with an opening blast of bright citrus, immediately given intriguing depth with a heart featuring rich, warm cedar and savory saffron. As the smooth, creamy vanilla of the base blends with the spices to create a mouthwatering mÃ©lange, an equally captivating castoreum/musk blend also asserts itself, balancing the delectable with the aphrodisiac. Finally, a fragrance guaranteed to make you smell delicious- in every way."," Bergamot, mandarin orange, saffron, cedar, jasmine, vanilla, castoreum and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51139.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Rose Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya possesses an undeniable talent for flirty, gorgeous florals. Her Hedonist Rose is a take of light airiness - a bouquet of fresh roses with a crisp white wine accord, like a chilled Sancerre with a hint of peach. Top notes of lemon and peach give way to a sultry base of clove, amber, musk and vanilla.Hedonist Rose is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine golden liquid. The bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather."," Lemon, clove, peach, rose, amber, musk, vanilla, and a cold glass of wine.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Iris Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Hedonist Iris is a perfect balance of the chic and the sensual. An elegant iris heart is warmed with cocoa, blackcurrant, labdanum, and musk. The effect is a graceful drydown, as the cool cloud of the iris petals settle into the warmth of labdanum and cocoa. Creamy, comforting and addictive (like an expensive French-milled soap), this is a must try for any iris lover.Iris being the most expensive raw material of all, I knew I did not need to search further when searching for inspiration for the new Hedonists. I concentrated on the flower's delicate scent instead of the root, which is what most perfumers do. Hence the scent is powdery but much more refined, and it reflects better the majesty of Iris. Timeless elegance is what I felt being expressed whenever I worked on each trial, and often times I get feedback that it just smells like The Woman. The indulging note here is cocoa, but I didn't want it to be overwhelming, so it stays delicately in the background. Labdanum gives a certain depth to the fragrance, which I found particularly interesting, while the composition stays sheer and chic."" – Viktoria Minya Hedonist Iris is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine liquid and the bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather.A Luckyscent exclusive!"," Bergamot, pink pepper, blackcurrant, iris, cedarwood, cocoa, labdanum, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Hongrie Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Eau de Hongrie is the revisitÃ© version of the famous Eau de la Reine de Hongrie (Water of the Queen of Hungary). The original Eau de la Reine de Hongrie was the first modern perfume referenced ever. According to the legend, the perfume was a gift from an angel and gave back youth and beauty to the aging Elisabeth in the 14th century, hence the Polish king fell in love and married her. In the 1300's the juice smelled pretty much smelled like rosemary tincture, so Minya decided to come up with a modern context of the famous scent. Today Hungary's famous Tokaji AszÃº ( Tokaji Essence ) represents a world wide appreciated dessert wine with proven medical benefits, this is why Eau de Hongrie evokes the honeyed aroma of this precious wine specialty.Lovers of gourmands and Tokaji Aszu alike will delight in the floating honey notes of Eau de Hongrie.  It is truly a bewitching elixir, capable of making one drunk just upon smelling.  Glittering citrus notes shape the opening of the scent, followed by smooth balsamic labdanum and immortelle.  A soft buzz of clove and a grounding sandalwood base finish it off, and all the time there is the glow of honey - warm and heavenly, as if it were dropped from the hands of an angel.It is represented in a unique wine-shaped bottle with the black textured wooden box."," Lemon, grapefruit, clove, jasmine, honey, sandalwood, immortelle, labdanum, musk, tonka bean and Tokaji Aszu wine.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

If this is how Parisians truly view our hometown, we will happily accept the compliment, and wear this one-of-a-kind fragrance with pride."," Key lime, ginger, cola accord, neroli petals, coriander seeds, thyme, macaron accord, amber, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Fresh Italian mandarin and orange blossom lend just a burst of crisp tartness before giving way to buttery orris and rich vanilla bean. A heart of lush florals entrances: a creamy magnolia balances against tuberose and lightly indolic jasmine, revealing a sly sensuality. And perhaps most interestingly, a lactonic milk-and-cereal accord sits at the center, recalling the simple pleasures of childhood.

Musc Tonkin Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," A powerful, addictive, erotic aura...The scent of heated flesh, solar, feline, subtly leathery. This elixir reinvents in a novel, contemporary style, the most suave note in perfumery, worshiped for millennia: Tonkin musk. More than a fragrance: an imprint.The Chinese have prized it since Antiquity for its aphrodisiac virtues. Its smell was considered so heavenly by Islam it was blended into the mortar of some mosques so that they would exhale it in the sun. It was so penetrating that ships loaded with tea would refuse to carry it for fear it would impregnate their cargo...Tonkin musk, produced by a species of Himalayan deer, was one of the most precious ingredients of the perfumers' palette: it suffused their blends with a sensual aura that fixed and magnified every other essence.No longer used for ethical reasons, natural musk still haunts perfumers since it has never been perfectly replaced. It is to capture this fascinating ghost that Musc Tonkin reinvents it by blending the most opulent raw materials to conjure its myriad facets. Their names don't matter: like the mysterious charisma of certain people who draw us into their wake, Musc Tonkin should be experienced rather than described.Vibrant, faceted, surprising, at once nocturnal and solar, this aphrodisiac potion changes on each skin, the better to enhance it. A lick of salt for the taste of skin. A heady floral whiff to remind us that perfume links our bodies to the erotic spells of nature. A mulled-fruit burn contrasting with a light, shimmering veil of powder...unctuous as honey, melting and waxy as the finest leather, the scent conjures living flesh heated by pleasure but also its mossy ink-black depths."," African stone absolute, musk, and after that, your guess is as good as ours.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Patchouli Absolu Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Patchouli Absolu is Tom Ford's personal ode to an ingredient that is intertwined with his own story. The iconic olfactive note of the 1970s, it evokes louche sensuality and after-dark glamour, as well as the heady blending of masculine and feminine that defined the era. This Eastern oil perfumed the skin of late seventies' glitterati and bohemians alike, pervading the air of jet-set parties with a provocative, dark glamour. Patchouli fragranced the world that was to shape Tom Ford's singular vision of style.Today, Tom Ford reinvents this influential ingredient into a truly vanguard scent for a new era. Patchouli Absolu merges three opulent””and distinctly different””versions of this iconic plant ingredient. Patchouli oil contributes raw and primal texture; patchouli coeur, the ultra-luxurious, absolute extract of the plant, contributes an elusive and refined earthiness, and a breakthrough iteration of patchouli called Clearwood, used for the very first time in perfumery, is the most exquisite and pure rendition of patchouli's darkly addictive signature ever captured. The merging of these three facets creates the uniquely unconventional heart of the fragrance. They create a prism effect, reflecting off each other to intensify the depth and intrigue that is inherent to patchouli. Patchouli Absolu has a hypnotic signature that pulses with dark mystery.Patchouli Absolu opens with wave upon wave of refined patchouli that coats your skin like dark brown velvet glittering with gold. Spicy sweetness fuses with multi-faceted woods and smokiness to create a lush, deeply sensual mix with enormous warmth. Tom Ford goes beyond the dusty earthiness and blackened camphor of many traditional patchouli fragrances, opting instead for subtle hints of green mosses and a wisp of fresh herbs, all wrapped up with dark woods and golden amber. In the drydown, the spicy, smoky woods turn creamy and soft with a touch of leather that feels like suede. The end result is not only plush, bold, and elegant from start to finish, but a far cry from the dirty, raw scent of the patchouli oils from the 1970s. In short, this is a patchouli fragrance for the 21st century, darkly sensual, luxurious, and sophisticated."," Bay leaf, rosemary, moss, patchouli oil, patchouli coeur, patchouli Clearwood, guaic wood, cypriol, violetwood, cashmere woods, tonka bean, amber, musks, leather Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Patchouli Absolu by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Russian Tea Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," Out there, the snow-covered Nevsky Prospekt, and a sumptuous Art Noveau building. Inside, a large bookstore. And, on the first floor, an elegant cafÃ¨. As water is poured in the cup, the infusion unleashes its most characteristic notes. Black tea, heavy and intense. A floral note, sharp and biting. And that unmistakably dry and smoky aftertaste given by the caravanserai campfires, meant to keep the precious tea cargo dry in the never-ending journey through Siberia. The fresh mint leaves give a pleasant fresh touch to the hot water. A teaspoon of raspberry preserve sweetens, without altering it, the bitter aftertaste of leather and birch. We sip it slowly, gazing out of the wide window, towards the beautiful cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan and beyond. The Russian Tea Ritual today carried us to an unexpected journey in remote lands, full of mystery and fascination.”œRussian Tea is a journey, a day spent in Russia with a boiling Samovar, reigning in the house as the center of socialization and sharing. The black tea smell is strong, diffusing all around the house. It also evokes the journey of the tea through Siberia, taking the smell of campfires, and transportation in harsh conditions, interpreted by woody and leathery notes. The fresh mint leaves blend incredibly well with the smokiness, and the hint of raspberry and cinnamon that sweeten the bitterness of the tea.” – Julien Rasquinet, perfumer"," Mint, black pepper, raspberry, black tea, magnolia, everlasting flower, leather accord, incense, birchwood, cistus-labdanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Capri Forget Me Not Parfum,Carthusia," ""Capri Forget me Not"" - In its name,  a promise: not to forget Capri,  the Capri of bygone days that inspires and cherishes the new Carthusia perfume. The recollection of the second ""Belle Epoque, "" at the end of the 60s,  during which elegance,  originality,  the forces of Nature,  lust,  musicality,  warmth and vitality made Capri then what it is still today - an island of great charm.The head note is defined by a dynamic and heady dash of the fresh lemon and orange orchards of the Blue Island where parties were held,  while the ripe earthiness of the wild fig tree makes up the marked heart note that recalls and envelops one in the wantonness of its ripe fruit,  with its soft consistency and fragrance. It all melds and dissolves into a sensual and secret evening repose...brought on by a vanilla finish.Don't forget Capri,  but don't let Capri forget you either: a hearty and original perfume for the someone who doesn't wish to pass unnoticed."," Lemon, orange, lime, mandarin, buchu, mint, fig, violet, eucalyptus, cyclamen, hyacinth, jasmine, davana, peach, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Ambre Precieux Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," For one of us here at Luckyscent, this is the one. The fragrance that started a torrid love affair with amber. What an amber it is -- warm, sweet, enveloping. So potent and rich that it has an almost narcotic effect – the world goes golden and hazy for a moment when we catch that first enthralling whiff. Vanilla, spice, peru balsam and tolu round out this irresistible blend, but at the heart of it is amber – sumptuous, magnificent, swoon-inducing amber. We fell in love all over again."," Myrtle, Lavander, Coumarin, Vanilla, Nutmeg, Labdanum Cistus, Peru Balsam, Tolu Balsam, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blamage Parfum Extrait,Nasomatto," ""This fragrance is an unwise and unfortunate creation caused by bad judgement and care."" The Nose.In the hands of any other creator, this statement might be an apology. For Alessandro Gualtieri, on the other hand, it's a mission statement: Blamage (""disgrace"" in German) may be a testament to mistakes and failures, but the result is as vibrantly intoxicating as each of its predecessors in the now-complete Nasomatto line. Inspired by legends of classic fragrances that achieved their unique character through mistakes in the design process, Gualtieri blindfolded himself, choosing four key (and undisclosed) ingredients at random. The perfume was painstakingly constructed from there, a process (portrayed in the upcoming documentary film ""The Nose- Searching For Blamage"") that took Gualtieri around the world and, supposedly, almost to the breaking point. In the end, however, this final fragrance from the much-beloved brand shines as brightly as the rest. Bright, citrusy/woodsy spice delivers an opening reminiscent of previous Nasomatto scents- but do we detect some fruit this time around? And, concept aside, don't worry about an apologetic sillage- as you might expect from the creator of Black Afgano, Blamage has huge projection and lasts for days. Powerful, intoxicating, and more than a little addictive, Blamage is the best possible kind of mistake- and it might just cause you to make a few mistakes you won't regret either.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intoxicated Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," No coffee tastes as good as it smells: but this sublime fragrance tantalizes the senses. Addicts crave a substance either as a prop against the harshness of life or to enhance its pleasures.INTOXICATED is emphatically the latter.Kilian Hennessy and Calice Becker conjure up the steam from an eggshell cup of rich viscous Turkish coffee laced with green cardamom in double strength - in oil and absolute - to glow as the opulent heart of the scent. Around this swells the warm spicy fragrance of hallucinogenic nutmeg & powdered cinnamon. At the base is the crystal sweetness of burnt caramelized sugar.Coffee so rich and strong it will hold a silver spoon upright. Coffee and scent both sensual and vigorous. Coffee as a stimulant, aphrodisiac and sleeping draught."," Cardamom, mocha coffee, cinnamon, tobacco, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42555.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A jeu d'esprit superbly realized by Kilian Hennessy and Fabrice Pellegrin to beguile you into the golden shadowland of dreams."," Eucalyptus, grapefruit, cardamom, mate tea, tagete, thyme, tobacco, birch",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42557.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Beneath a gorgeous royal blue glass flacon embedded with a certified blue sapphire gemstone, Blue Sapphire presents an exuberant, joyous, and larger than life celebration of monarchy- meant for the kind of noble, beautiful queens that storybook princesses grow up to become. Top notes of lemon, orange and a green accord imbue the opening with an exhilarating, yet sophisticated allure that gives way to a luxurious heart of rose, cardamom, and Indian jasmine. A deep, sensuous base of oudh, patchouli and soft amber exudes majesty and elegance- like any true queen, Blue Sapphire wields her power with dignity.The mysterious beauty of the blue sapphire is said to capture the qualities of leadership, wisdom, harmony and trust that a good leader must possess.

L'Art de la Guerre Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," There is an olfactive family, a perfume territory, which is traditionally emblematic of men; the Fern. This same fern that awakens in us the memory of the one who gave us our first romantic thrill, sometimes by stealing the fragrance of one of his elders.A woman wearing fern can do it in memory of past conquests or in nostalgia for the comfort of her father's arms. But she can also just do it to defy people around her with alluring and provocative scents. A man wears it for the same reasons, sometimes nostalgic, others conqueror, manly, confident.Francois Henin, Jovoy's owner and founder, needed a fresh, visionary and talented eye to address the delicate issue of revisiting such a classic universe. It was Vanina Murraciole, and the fragrance in development would soon be known as L'Art de la Guerre (The Art of War).""The first test made me smile. I knew that the first fresh and incisive rhubarb note was what this fragrance needed to stand out among its nine siblings. Then, the genius of a“clean” note, a handsome man who shaves himself, takes care of himself, perfumes himself. And at last, the long-awaited fern, slightly tinted by smoked immortal flowers, but woody and spicy.... I was at the time caught in a series of trips and found myself emptying the testers one after the other. I knew that other Noses were working on this bouquet, but I had made my decision, Vanina was right."" – FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin"," Calabrian Bergamot, Rhubarb, Lavender Maillette, Immortelle, Nutmeg, Violet Leaf, Indonesia Patchouli, Sandalwood Australia, Leather, Oak moss, Corsica Cistus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wode Eau de Parfum,Boudicca," Wode opens with spices and green– coriander, cardamom, clary sage and juniper berries. There is clean earth and a hint of flowers and ocean and it all seems quite brisk and pleasant, until the opium accord kicks in, bitter and unsettling and hopelessly attractive. A stroll in the woods becomes a trek through a primeval forest with a few glowing yellow eyes peering at you from the shadows. A dark and ethereal swirl of resins and animalic notes dances around a heart of amber, leather and musk-- and there is an intriguing undercurrent of something raw and untamed, softened by a soft whisper of sweetly narcotic tuberose. The overall impression is not heavy – but airy and elemental, like the landscape after a fierce and cleansing storm.  Iconoclast perfumer Geza Schoen (of Escentric Molecules fame) has taken his inspiration from the scent of raw opium.  It reminds us of wet stone, and the way rain unlocks mysterious scents from the earth. Imagine dancing around Stonehenge while thunder rolls through the sky. The inspiration is ancient, but the scent itself is very modern–unusual, intriguing, and subtle enough to make it easy to wear, for both men and women.  Appropriately addictive."," Juniper, cardamon, pink pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, coriander seed, jasmin, rose, tuberose, angelica root, Opium accord, saffron, tonka bean, styrax, amber, treemoss, musk, leather, sandalwood, blonde tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Orpheline Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens wants to explore the mysterious places between the moon and the earth through contrasting elements of black, white, silver, and plush cream. His new L'orpheline begins with the night sky, pitch black from smoky incense, then pierced by the silver light of the moon's sparkling aldehydes. Billowing clouds of myrrh add to the impression of crystal clear brightness, but they are also cool in the style of an Avignon incense fragrance. The incense and aldehydes swirl, dance, and weave their way down to earth where they settle on a pillow of cashmere woods and delicately spiced warmth. Very quickly, L'orpheline transforms itself into the most addictive blend of smoky, woody cream. Clean musk, amber, and a hint of spices dust the soft woods, but the fleecy softness outweighs them all. In its drydown, L'orpheline is like an angora blanket that hugs your skin with comforting, delicate coziness, giving you a gentle caress of meditative incense and pillow-soft creaminess. L'orpheline's transformation is complete. L'orpheline is an Haute Concentration eau de parfum, but its elegant softness make it one of Uncle Serge's more versatile creations. While it could easily be worn to work, we love to snuggle up to it after a long day at work. Its very serene drydown is a wonderful antidote to stress, or maybe we just really love creamy cashmere with incense."," Aldehydes,  cedar wood, Â fougere accord,  coumarin,  clouds of ambergris,  patchouli,  incense,  and Cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36146.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Sotto La Luna Gardenia Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Sotto La Luna is a world that is secluded, private in a sense. The world is sleeping. The busy human world has come to a rest. Flower pods open, alluring the creatures of the night. Flowers bloom in the light of a celestial body that does not shine itself, but reflects the sun. It is a reminder of the day, a gentle light pouring down from a cold round rock in a frozen galaxy. The moonlight feels like a luminescent fluid poured over a shadow land. The shadows are long and dark. Sotto la luna is joyful and sentimental at the same time.Tauer's inspiration for Sotto La Luna Gardenia was the imagery of a gardenia under the moon. The scent flowers out with a spicy freshness, it matures into a round, gentle green floral perfume reminiscent of a hundred different flowers, it closes with powdery mosses and a creamy floral woodiness that disappears into the night. A soft gardenia, shiny but not blazing, a fine and beautiful flower, a harmonious perfume blending into the night.""Sitting next to my gardenia plant, smelling, making notes, I learned that the gardenia fragrance is different every day.

Musc Monoi Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," A traditional Tahitian MonoÃ¯, made with handpicked tiare flowers infused for weeks into pure coconut oil, is a precious substance with countless uses: skin oil, moisturizer, perfume, pain reliever. To Patricia de NicolaÃ¯, it's the scent that perfectly represents the airy, playfully indulgent essence of summer, a fragrance profile forever linked in her memory to L'Oreal's iconic Ambre Solaire sunscreen. Musc MonoÃ¯ is de NicolaÃ¯'s ode to Ambre Solaire, to traditional MonoÃ¯, and to every carefree summer memory and sun-kissed beach between the two.Your very first sniff of Musc MonoÃ¯ will whisk you to the tropics: rich, sweet ylang ylang and bright, tart citrus energizes and then immediately relaxes, like the first burst of direct sunlight over a lush beachside garden. Magnolia, neroli and jasmine take turns adding to the bouquet, while a tasteful hint of calone suggests a salty ocean breeze, carrying a fresh breath of nature with each shift in the wind. As the musky coconut base fades in, it's as welcome and soothing as a mid-day nap on pillowy-soft white sand. This isn't the smell of sunscreen; it's the smell of you, wearing sunscreen, on the most impossibly beautiful beach in the world."," Neroli, lemon, petitgrain, ylang-ylang, jasmine, coconut, calone, magnolia, sandalwood, and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31348.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nymphaea Caerulea Extrait de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs," An out of body experience,    Nymphaea Caerulea dances on the skin with extremely rare hyper-purified extractions of the sacred blue waterlily. The extraction used in Nymphaea Caerulea was only produced once ever in the early 2000s in India. Â The blossoms of two acre-sized ponds worth of Blue Waterlilies were carefully collected before sunrise when their scent was at its most potent. The blooms were then bathed with a special proprietary solution to gently dissolve the flowers and release the aromatic constituents without heat or pressure creating an extraction much like a traditional absolute but more ""clear"" in scent profile. This absolute was then refined further through a very careful low-heat hydro-distilation using only a copper and glass apparatus in the manner of the time-honored traditional attar-making process (but without the use of sandalwood oil),    further removing plant particles,    waxes,    and pigments. The care and precision applied to the production of this material is unparalleled. The result is a natural aromatic material that is stunning and truly once in a lifetime. Like the enchanting call of Sirens to chosen wayward ships,    the mesmerizing base of Nymphaea Caerulea features an abundance of genuine white Ambergris,    supported by celestial notes and shimmering accords composed of 80 ingredients: both precious naturals and intuitively selected aroma materials.The touching salty-sweet opening of Nymphaea Caerulea is at once nostalgic,    hopeful and altogether new. An uncanny lemony impression that bares no hint of tartness gives way to perfumed leaves and flower water. Constantly wavering between“deep blue” and“emerald green,   ” “air” and“water,   ”“boldness” and“gentleness,   ” the result is a symphonic aquamarine lullaby within a nebula. Among the many intriguing qualities of this perfume is that to some it recalls impressions of various unusual smells: freeze dried apple,    toothpaste,    glass cleaner... and yet there is an undeniable beauty and constant floralcy that dominates and mesmerizes the senses in the way that burying one's whole face in a giant lotus blossom would. Shimmering salt crystals on unripened berries. Smokeless incensed altar. Waterfall. And finally,    the haunting: the boldly lingering,    vaguely caramel,    oceanic ambergris. The truest scent of mermaid skin; A singing iridescent floral.”œMysterious and beguiling... pulls you in,    which is what a good fragrance should do...a winner.” -Luca Turin,    author of Perfumes: The Guide"," Egyptian blue lotus, Indian blue lotus, Hawaiian blue lotus, Sri Lankan blue lotus, Thai blue lotus, white ambergris, aurora reconstitution, Nile waterlily headspace, pandanus amaryllifolius, salty water, and the absolutes of 15 flowers.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Journey Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Like a Chinese dragon, Journey Man opens with a fiery roar filled with Sichuan peppers and bold spices in a golden, boozy flame. The peppers tingle and gently bite, while a richly fruited sweetness intoxicates you with a cognac note. It's a visual of gold and red, but darkness lurks all around, thanks to swirls of incense, an oud-like cypriol woodiness, and a streak of leathery resins in the base. Tobacco, a sprinkling of cardamom, and the juiciness of neroli orange are the final touches to a complex fragrance that grabs your attention from the start.Journey is slowly transformed by a beautiful creaminess which tames the dragon's fiery bite. A smooth layer of tonka vanilla coats the peppers, dry woodiness, incense, and spices. The cognac booziness turns into ambered warmth, and the perfume lingers more softly on the skin. Over time, Journey turns into a creamy, tonka sweetness with woods, spices, and just a hint of fruit mingle together. It's a bold fragrance whose initial intensity gives way to softness in a rich mix that feels very much like an Amouage."," Sichuan pepper, Bergamot, Cardamom, Neroli Bigarade, Juniper Berries, Incense, Geraniol, Tobacco Leaves, Ambrox, Cyriol, Tonka Bean Abstract",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41860.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Or du Serail Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," A dreamy meditation on dried fruit and Shisha tobacco. If your mind instantly goes to the cherry tobacco that graced your father's pipe in your youth, you're on the right track, but think more humid, more voluptuous, and more intricate. The fruit is a mix of apple, orange, mango and coconut, drizzled with honey and rum. The rich, golden tobacco is layered with greener, sharper aromatics, like clary sage and matÃ©. Throw in amber, vanilla and labdanum and you would assume this would be heavy and velvet-like - but instead it gives the impression of silken veils, each opulent and shimmering with fine embroidery, but sheer and vibrant. The veils float and swirl and each movement creates a different layering, a new set of colors playing against each other. The impression is indeed golden, rather than dark, and playfully seductive. There is a teasing haylike sharpness that freshens the smokiness of the tobacco and the mango and sweet orange give the amber a twist. A luscious vanilla floats through like something delicious being cooked in the next room. Bertrand Duchaufour has concocted a delightful invitation to temptation that hints at decadence in the most graceful way. Charmingly sensuous."," Cistus, apple & red fruit effects, mango, rum, sweet orange, davana, sage, bee wax, honey effect, coco, geranium, ylang-ylang, Turkish tobacco, amber, labdanum, oak tree, cedar wood, musk, vanilla, matÃ©.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A man and his horse in front of the fire on a great plain under tall, blue evening skies - A defining image of the spirit of the American West with all it implied about masculinity and personal freedom.

Corsica Furiosa Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," A verdant blast built around lentiscus, an evergreen shrub typical of Corsica. Wood, moss, earth, hay, honey, and in every shade, its sillage carries the smells of the mountain. Energizing and impetuous.Furioso. The term, used as a direction in music, means“to be played rapidly and with passion”... Because Corsica, where Marc- Antoine Corticchiato has his roots, is never restful. It sends your eyes, your nose, your heart into overdrive. So when you're close to bursting with sensations and emotions, you take to the mountains.The perfumer's new tribute to his homeland was inspired by the moving scent that greets the returning traveler: the green, intense, facetted fragrance of lentiscus, a shrub that grows on the sunny slopes of Corsica, from the highlands to the Mediterranean seaside.But Corsica Furiosa is far more than that: the quintessence of everything that makes the“Island of Beauty” unique, fierce and strong. The violent contrasts of its smells, colors, reliefs, passions, secrets...Since everyone in Corsica has their own recipe for it, a fiery swig of eau-de-vie sets the top notes ablaze. In its combustible wake, it trails the green bite of nepita, a local variety of wild mint. Crisp green tomato leaf intensifies the natural vibe.When lentiscus kicks in, the plot thickens. The headstrong essential oil is the first to take off. Peppery, fruity, aromatic, then earthy with mushroom overtones, it thrusts itself into the heart of Corsica Furiosa. Then the absolute takes over with a smoother shade of green with hay, blond tobacco, honey and straw accents, darkened with a tinge of liquorish. A third type of extraction, obtained through a special technique, adds wafts of resin, spices and leather that draw you deeper into the mountain... until you come to rest on a bed of moss."," Lentiscus oil, eau-de-vie, nepita (a local variety of wild mint), lentiscus absolute, tomato leaf, pepper, lentiscus extract original, cistus, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Tango Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," As with all great stories, Tango immediately sets the stage: bergamot, black pepper and cardamom whisk us away to a sultry summer night in the Canary Islands, a party already in full swing. The music swells louder as you tip back another glass of local honey rum, heady, sweet and inebriating.

Oeillet Louis XV Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Powdery and peppery, silky and spicy, Oeillet Louis XV soothes yet confuses with its paradoxes. Reminiscent of an ancient time, powder fades and gives way to spicy notes of clove. Oeillet Louis XV is homage to the beloved French King Louis XV who saw Oriza's birth and became its most illustrious customer. White carnation is at the heart of this fragrance and is the source of its dichotomy. A symbol of true love under the monarchy, the flower embodied the fire of the French Revolution. As a scent, white carnation is as intoxicating as the most subtle poison; a delicate blend of mandarin, monarchical iris and light wood chords, which cannot resist the violence of pepper and spicy clove. Pink carnation brings a note of bitterness, a symbol of Mary's sorrow.Legend has it that the flower sprang where Mary's tears fell as she saw Jesus carry the cross. Contrasts, olfactory and symbolic, best describe“Oeillet Louis XV”, an elegant scent that never ceases to astonish.Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Pink pepper, mandarin, white carnation, carnation absolute, white orchid, iris, rose, spicy clove, rice powder, white musk, white honey, woody notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65215.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Jardins d'Armide Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Les Jardins d'Armide are a symbol of beauty, lush and beautiful, full of fragrant flowers and the rarest species. The beautiful gardens were long mythical, but the success of the Renaissance myth of Armida gave these imaginary incomparable gardens a new impetus. The Great Century in France did not escape the attraction of myths. There was a genuine passion for symbolism, illusions, and enchantments. Armide, an emblematic seventeenth century witch, was a woman of great beauty who knew the art of seduction. She best embodies the ambivalent powers of charm. She is inextricably tied to these extraordinary gardens, so much so that the term ""Gardens of Armida"" became a reference in fashion during the subsequent centuries. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Gardens of Armida are incessantly referred to in music (Lully, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Rossini ...), painting (Poussin, Van Dyck, Tiepolo, Fragonard ...) and literature. This myth began with another one, the myth of Tasso in the sixteenth century. In 1909, the prestigious Maison de Parfums Oriza L. Legrand presented“Jardins d'Aramide” to its elegant clientele, le tout-Paris, in its prestigious boutique 11 Place de la Madeleine.The perfume is a tribute to the legendary gardens and the women who have symbolized them throughout the ages. The Rose, Queen of Flowers, is at the heart of this enchanting bouquet picked in the Garden of Armida. Iris from Florence, wild violet powder, wisteria and carnations from India, whilst honey, almond and musk bring incomparable strength to this tempting elixir.Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Rose, orange blossom, iris powder, florentine Iris, wild violet, wisteria, carnation from India, honey, almond, tonka bean, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Reve d'Ossian Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Ossianizm was a romantic poetry style in Europe in the XIX century. Ossian is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of Celtic and epic poems. Ossian was influential in the development of the romantic movement at the end of the XVIIIth and the XIXth century. The poems achieved international success (NapolÃ©on Bonaparte was a great fan) and many writers, painters and artists were influenced by the works, including Ingres, Schubert and Oriza L. Legrand Perfumes. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging Romantic movement and the theory of the ""noble savage"". ""RÃªve d'Ossian"" is a perfect perfume for those seeking dark and precious essences, wooden notes filled with the mystery of the forest with fairies and pixies...Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Frankincense, pine wood, cinnamon, benzoin, tonka bean, opopanax, tolu balm, sandalwood, leather, labdanum, amber, musks.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Horizon Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," After World War I, the Roaring Twenties reflected the desire for exoticism and the need for escape, particularly through fashion and decoration. The East and particularly Asia provides new horizons. The frenzy for exotic travel encourages artists to exhibit eastern cultures in their creations: new silk, fine embroidery, pearl beads, woody scents, heady and sweet ... In the euphoria of the Roaring Twenties, the female body was revealed, the corset was abolished, the flappers showed-off, smoking languidly. One slummed in the salons of Paris! At the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, the materials, colours and shapes embody a new freedom and claim the hope of a new horizon. At the height of its history and in its own way to celebrate the Roaring Twenties and the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts in 1925, the House Oriza L.

What I Did on My Holidays Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," As with several of Sarah McCartney's signature fragrances, What I Did On My Holidays was inspired by a character in one of McCartney's novels, in this case a teenage girl on holiday with her family at the British seaside. Fans of the brand will surely recognize that 4160 Tuesdays already has a ""UK beach holiday"" themed scent, but while Sunshine & Pancakes was rich with a variety of creatively evocative notes like jasmine and lemon, What I Did On My Holidays takes aim squarely at the real smells of a boardwalk-laced English holiday area: the kind full of chip shops, clanging arcade rides, and blissfully happy families. Creamy suntan lotion, brisk sea air, peppermint, cotton candy, and vanilla ice cream- there's a lot going on here, but it all combines into one perfectly relaxing, completely lovely day at the beach.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sunshine and Pancakes Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Originating as a custom bespoke fragrance for perfumer Sarah McCartney's family, Sunshine & Pancakes is meant to evoke a 1970's British seaside family vacation. A burst of sunny citrus projects warmth and sunshine, while an impressive dose of natural jasmine represents warm skin after a day at the beach. Honey and vanilla absolutes present the titular pancakes as the ideal childhood snack: rich, sweet and indulgent. A heart of cedarwood lends substance and represents happy people enjoying life on holiday. A vacation in a bottle that doesn't require a passport."," Cedarwood, citrus fruit, lemons, jasmine, honey, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Sexiest Scent on the Planet. Ever. (IMHO) Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," What happened was that Sarah McCartney spent a week in the Hoxton Hotel courtyard in spring 2013,  making The Gin Garden scent with gin botanicals and a lovely smooth base for them to blend with.A couple of people,   including the visiting Tatler journalist,  fell in love with the base. The name came from one of the comments about it-- so Sarah thought perhaps it would be a good idea to bottle it the way it is. So she did.The idea was to make a gentle unassuming blend of background scents that wouldn't try to steal the limelight from the more individual gin botanicals. There is a dash of bergamot - a nice quiet citrus - and a soft hint of creamy vanilla. Then there's some velvety smooth woods and (non animal) musk and ambergris floating around. When one of their guests described it as ""The Sexiest Scent On The Planet. Ever. IMHO, "" they knew it had to be shared with the world. That's it really. And it's quite lovely,  to say the least."," Gin, bergamot, vanilla, woods, musk, ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Dark Heart of Old Havana Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Based on Sarah McCartneys memories of a 1998 trip to Cuba, The Dark Heart Of Old Havana is an all-night adventure through the winding alleyways of the city that has long captivated literary imagination. McCartney has loaded The Dark Heart with the fixtures of a Havana adventure: sugar, tobacco, fruit, coffee, warm bodies, alcohol, exuberance, and recklessness, for a scent that never sacrifices its adventurousness just to smell nice- but never stops smelling nice, either. McCartney's trip to Havana culminated in an impromptu onstage tango performance at the legendary nightlife institution Caseron del Tango.

While quiet in the opening, sweet tobacco builds on the skin and rounds out the sharpness that initially calls the wearer's attention.

Terralba Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," In front of you, the sea. Behind, mediterranean shrubland.  It is morning.  The smells of shrubs and the earth mingle intimately and indistinguishably with the salty breath of the sea. You walk cautiously on the rocks of the small pathway leading to the beach, following – almost chasing – the sound of the waves, finding your way through the thick vegetation. It is a narrow and steep pathway. You touch the branches of the bushes. A bent branch bleeds a dense and sticky resinous liquid, whose strong and vital scent doesn't want to leave your skin. At last – in front of you – deep blue. The horizon expands and you abandon yourself to the sounds and the view of the mighty ocean sea.Terralba is a scent for those searching for an immediate mediterranean escape - it calls to mind Antonioni's L'Avventura, where a group of friends scours an isolated island for a woman who has gone missing among the freedom of the breeze and the sound of the waves.  It is everything sweet and beautiful about a hike across the heath - no bitterness or sharpness to be found among these swaying shrubs.  The green tangerine and everlasting flower lend a soft sweetness while the sage, myrtle, thyme, and lentisc provide a plush herbal background and deep green woods anchor the composition.  Perhaps you will lose yourself between the sun-soaked rocks and the waves as well."," Clary Sage, Lemon, Green Tangerine, Myrtle, Thyme, Curry Leaves, Everlasting Flower, Lentisque, Juniper, Cypress, Cedar Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Montecristo Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," You are in the living room of an old villa, in the Tuscan countryside.  It is the close of day.  Every single element of the interior contributes to the warmth and reassuring comfort. The floor of old robust wood planks, aged and worn with use. In the massive fireplace, coals are still burning. The comfortable couch is made of the best leather, once stout and rigid, and spotlessly tanned, is now soft and worn, and the color is fading away with years of sideways afternoon sun. A deck of used playing cards lies abandoned on the coffee table next to the tobacco leaves of a hand rolled cigar and a glass of rum.Montecristo strikes an impeccable balance between smokey and sweet and modern and classic.  It has an unfaltering solidness yet it maintains a mysterious movement.  Smooth notes of ambrette, benzoin, and rum rest atop the enticing sweetness of gaiac wood.  Spice and tobacco curl like a plume of smoke in the last rays of sunlight.  The entire evening is ahead of you and who knows what it will bring - surely a warm contentment and a deep long sleep."," Cabreuva, Ambrette Seeds, Rum, Tobacco Leaves, Celery Seeds, Cistus, Benzoin, Golden Stone, Styrax Gum, Gaiac Wood, Cedar Wood, Patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Luci Ed Ombre Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano," You walk through a thick wood where only small beams of light can shine through.  The trees are heavy with moss and the soft and spicy scent of earth. Determined blooms of jasmine and tuberose fight for the sparse light that will keep them alive. A shiver runs down your back and you feel the humid breathe of a wolf down your neck.  An uneasiness directs you into a broad meadow where the blinding light makes you sneeze. You overturn a log: damp ground and creatures that haven't seen the sun in years. You no longer know where you are or where you long to be. The dark side is irresistibly fascinating, perhaps stronger than any fears and uneasiness it produces.Luci ed Ombre speaks to chiaroscuro, or the practice of using light and dark in painting for dramatic effect.  These opposites not only cohabit a space but also make one another more powerful.  The scent portrays both an energetic freshness and a dark animalic truth.  Notes of ginger and earthy patchouli balance indolic florals and a wisp of incense. A perfect scent for those seeking something truly mysterious and captivating."," Incense, Ginger, Tuberose, Jasmine, Moss, Cedarwood, Patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bal d'Afrique Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent.  Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself.  A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupÃ§on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub – sweet and adorable, but it still has claws.  Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, african marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, moroccan cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pulp Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Pulp is the epitome of ripe fruit, bottled. Imagine that you have just bitten into the juiciest, ripest plum, felt the snap of a crisp apple in your teeth, indulged in a handful of berries ready to explode, all fresh from the fields and orchards, the kiss of the sun still on them. Now put it all in your mouth at the same time and you have the cacophony of fruit that is Pulp. This is grown-up fruit: no sugar-coating, no syrup, just a tiny hint of sweetness to bring out the nuances.  With a whiff of blossom and a touch of bark, you can sense an olfactory arc of how the fruit begins, grows, and ripens. Pulp will make you smile and feel a bit giddy, because there is nothing else quite like it."," Bergamot, cardamom, black currant, fig, red apple, tiara, cedar wood, praline, peach flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gypsy Water Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy – strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire – golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top.  This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous."," Bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Noir Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Some roses are best smelled in the dark. Rose Noir takes the innocence of a fresh Damascene rose and tramples it underfoot.  The romance of the bed strewn with rose petals intensifies as the petals mingle with the decadent fragrances of sensuality.  You can languish in that aroma, made peppery by freesia, and darkened with earthy cistus, green moss, and animalic musk. Rose Noir is a contemporary rose, dirtied up and served with a nice dollop of sensuality."," Grapefruit, freesia, rose damascena, cistus, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blanche Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," An effortlessly lovely ode to the color white. This opens with the crystalline sharpness of aldehydes, and then eases into a gentle white floral washed with soft sandalwood and transparent musk. Blanche is as light as a bubble floating on a warm summer wind and as clean as the steam from a long, hot shower. This is definitely in the family of freshly laundered scents, but it has a delicious warmth at its core that sets it apart. The ephemeral sweetness of the violet is anchored with the delectable milky richness of the sandalwood.  Blanche does not bring to mind harsh detergents or astringent cleansers, but rather the creamy lather of French-milled soap on clean, wet skin. As sheer and weightless as silk chiffon, you could wrap yourself in it and it would still read as delicate and airy. A classic and elegant rendering of the concept of“clean”, it balances the brisk, fresh elements with soft, sensual ones. Pure and beautiful."," White rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sunday Cologne Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," In the 18th century, the Italian perfume maker of the original Eau de Cologne, Giovanni Maria Farina, wrote to his brother that,“I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain.”œThe essential qualities of eau de cologne, the lightest of all the perfume categories, with their fresh and casually elegant mix of citrus, floral, and herb oils, have remained intact throughout the centuries. This basic DNA of eau de cologne remains in Byredo's Sunday Cologne,  but with added body and depth, warmth and diffusion. Star anise and cardamom add a touch of olfactory heat and sweetness to Sunday Cologne. Meanwhile, incense adds a spicy bite; patchouli displays a rough, camphorous glow; moss and vetiver harmonize to add a touch of earthiness. Sunday Cologne perfectly balances crispness with warmth, convention with edge."," Bergamot, star anise, cardamom, geranium, incense, lavender, vetiver, moss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baudelaire Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"“...A lazy isle to which nature has given singular trees, savory fruits, men with bodies vigorous and slender, and women in whose eyes shines a startling candor.”The poet Charles Baudelaire, famously a lover of perfume and the exoticism of faraway lands, was by turns cerebral, sensual, perverse, and sentimental. Byredo's homage to the French dandy reflects this mercurial nature with its multiple olfactory dimensions.A gentle sweetness lies at the heart of Baudelaire, with hyacinth warmed by amber and a touch of fruit. This sentimental center gives way to the aromatics of caraway, patchouli, and juniper berries, with their green whiff of the brisk outdoors. Baudelaire's base truly provides a counterpoint to its initial warmth, the way that his poetry often launches into philosophy: sensuality gives way to aridity, with a dry, incense-y base of leather, patchouli and papyrus.Earthy yet worldly, warm yet sophisticated, Baudelaire is as elegant as a dandy's walking stick."," Juniper berry, Black pepper, Caraway, Incense, Hyacinth, Leather, Papyrus, Patchouli, Black amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Tulipe Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," A graceful rendering of the scent of a single, perfect tulip. What's that you say? You don't recall tulips having much of a scent? You are not alone. According to Byredo creator Ben Gorham,“A lot of people say that tulips don't have a scent, so this is a fantasy based on the idea of a tulip.” And we agree that this exquisitely realized soliflore of the imagination is exactly what a tulip should smell like. Clean, modern and bright, with an intensely floral heart and a bit of green stem that has broken through the icy ground to start the spring.La Tulipe captures the slight bit of waxiness of the tulip petals, thanks to rhubarb, and the cool, damp earthiness of the bulb, courtesy of vetiver.  It is refreshingly unsweet, and has a clarity and charm that makes it one of our favorites for those days when one just craves a breath of fresh air. La Tulipe is as simple and elegant as a single red tulip in a crystal vase and just as appropriate for any occasion."," Rhubarb, cyclamen, freesia, tulip, blond woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Accord Oud,BYREDO," Byredo's Accord Oud presents a striking set of olfactory opposites. The warm sweetness of blackberry and boozy rum pair with a camphorous glow from patchouli. And saffron's rounded softness is set against the sharp and smoky birch of a leather accord. Powdery musks resolve and fill in some of these opposites, and notes like clary sage complement the birch and patchouli.A resinous, aromatic, fruity leather, Byredo's Accord Oud suggests that oud is as much a mysterious set of olfactory characteristics ”” sweet, medicinal, soft, and dark ”” as it is an actual perfume note."," Blackberry, Saffron, Rum, Leather Accord, Clary Sage, Patchouli, Powdery Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Immortel Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Oud is often thought of as dark, brooding and mysterious. Even the way it comes into the world has a whiff of drama about it: When the Aquilaria tree is infected by a mold, it secretes a protective resin which eventually becomes the precious, fragrant oud wood note. But Byredo's Oud Immortel bucks the trend and puts a smoky, earthy oud accord in the background, even though its name has top billing. It opens with a gourmand vanillic lemon accord, which contrasts with an earthy, herbaceous base of tobacco leaves, moss, patchouli and papyrus. This base cuts the sweetness with a mysterious dryness, making the scent edgier than sweet scents usually are. And, although it's not listed, it would make sense if the immortel flower, both savory and syrupy sweet, were romping around in Oud Immortel.Oud Immortel's lemon scent is courtesy of Limoncello, the aromatic citrus-fruity, candied Italian digestif, the major key personality to the oud's minor key. In the background, the slightly medicinal, camphory vibe from patchouli allows a brighter, happier, fruitier character to speak, accented with warming spices of cardamom.Smoke and mystery combine with sweetness and warmth to create a paradoxical fragrance both friendly and mysterious. Oud Immortel invites you in with candied lemon and cardamom, and then leaves you entranced with its smoky tobacco leaves, sheer oud accord, and moss."," Limoncello, incense, cardamom, patchouli, papyrus, Brazilian rosewood, tobacco leaves, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64113.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Saffron Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Saffron is a spice. Saffron is a color. Saffron is a way of life. Black Saffron pays tribute to the many facets of saffron, weaving a spell of a spice symbolic of India. A vibrant citrus opening belies the deeper heart of the perfume. The aroma of saffron starts to wrap around you like holy robes, earthy and unmistakable. A dewy rose emerges, tickling your nose with a soft sweetness. Then, there it is, the surprise of leather nestled among the woods and vetiver. At once ancient and modern, Black Saffron brings all the traditions of the East alive while winking at you from the seat of a sleek motorcycle.Byredo founder Ben Gorham, who was raised in India, worked with perfumer Jerome Epinette to create this homage to the holy spice that has become a symbol of India."," Pomelo, saffron, juniper berries, black violet, accord cuir, cristal rose, blonde woods, raspberry, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Inflorescence Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," A freshly cut bouquet of flowers that has been supercharged, as if struck by electricity or cross-bred with blossoms from another planet: radiant lily of the valley, honeyed freesia, creamy magnolia, incandescent jasmine – all captured at the height of their bloom, dazzling and stark white in contrast to glossy green leaves. The lily of the valley is especially vivid and luminous, giving this the heightened, otherworldly beauty of a perfect day in spring, with the skies a bright enameled blue and the new grass so vivid it is almost neon.Inflorescence is airy and euphoric. There is nothing dark or heavy to weigh down the dewy green notes or the profusion of glowing flowers. It has a scintillating lightness, in the sense that it floats and trills like a flute solo, not in the sense of being a shy or soft scent. This is bright and strongly present and joyously feminine from beginning to end."," Rose petals, pink freesia, magnolia, lily of the valley, fresh jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64117.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1996 Eau de Parfum,BYREDO," Byredo's 1996 perfume was inspired by Dutch photography duo Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin's photograph“Kirsten 1996, ” which depicts an angelic child,  her face seemingly dusted with white powder,  her eyes closed and lips lacquered like a geisha's. 1996 is its olfactory counterpart: gentle and dreamy,  with an undertow of dark erotics.1996 bursts forth with a cloud of amber-scented iris,  as powdery-soft and diffuse as the incandescent photograph itself. A leather accord dosed with patchouli and black pepper gives its ethereal,  confectionary opening some heft and drama. Inez & Vinoodh move freely between both the fashion and art worlds and are known for their hyper-real and digitally retouched photos. They put a sheen of the otherworldly onto their images,  and there is something both earthy ”” the leather,  patchouli and rootiness of iris ”” and elusive and dreamy about 1996,  as if an added layer of fairy dust were sprinkled onto its more legible notes. Byredo founder Ben Gorham has said that 1996 is“an olfactory snapshot not only of the image but of our emotional response to it.” Enigmatic and romantic,  1996 will be sure to elicit perfume lust and emotion."," Juniper berries, black pepper, violet, leather accord, orris, patchouli, black amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cedrat Enivrant Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne," Inspired by the French 75 cocktail, recently revisited by the Raines Law Room, the New York speakeasy co-founded by Sylvie Ganter, CÃ©drat Enivrant is built around a refreshing, quenching blend of lemon and gin notes.CÃ©drat Envirant, like all of Atelier's Cologne Absolues, has a 15% concentration, with an equally intoxicating composition of  Moroccan cedrat, Mexican lime, Calabrian bergamot, Chinese mint, Egyptian basilica, Macedonian juniper, Brazilian tonka bean, Haitian vetiver, and Phillipine elemi.Another deliciously modern, mouthwatering  twist on the classic cologne. This juicy cocktail will delight fans of Atelier's Orange Sanguine."," Moroccan cedrat, Mexican lime, Calabrian bergamot, mint, basil, juniper berries, tonka bean, vetiver, elemi.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nuit Andalouse Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," A dreamy white floral centered around gardenia, the queen of tropical flowers. Nuit Andalouse opens with a sweet, delicate violet that perfectly sets the stage for the euphoric gardenia ahead, like a flower girl dropping petals before the radiant bride steps down the aisle. A sparkling orange note appears, clear and bell-like, which then blends with heady orange blossom, soft creamy vanilla and the luminous gardenia to create a fragrance with the luscious, but airy, quality of a mousse or semifreddo –  smooth and delicious, but never too heavy or rich. Created by CÃ©cile Zarokian, this lovely scent pulls off the difficult feat of balancing elegance and charm. It is as exquisitely feminine as the rustle of silk skirts and as light-hearted as a kiss blown in the wind. Rose and ylang ylang contribute to the lushness of the flowers and sensuous sandalwood and musk add cozy warmth. All of these elements are but supporting players to the gardenia, however – doing whatever is necessary to show off our sweet and glowing diva to her best effect. Romantic and lovely."," Orange, green notes, violet, gardenia, ylang ylang, rose, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, salicylates",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eight and Bob Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob," When American student John F. Kennedy met Parisian aristocrat Albert Fouquet on the Cotes d'Azur in the 1930s, not only was he charmed by the man, he was also intrigued by his hand-crafted scent. Upon his return to the US, JFK made a quirky request for eight samples ””“and if your production allows, another one for Bob”.EIGHT & BOB, as the cologne came to be known, was a hit with the Hollywood elite, but it would languish for decades after Albert's tragic death in a car crash. WWII forced Fouquet's loyal butler Philippe”” the only other person who knew the cologne's formula”” to hide his final shipment of bottles inside books that he carefully cut by hand.But EIGHT & BOB has returned. Based on its original formula, this bright, elegant cologne with the rare“Andrea” plant extract from the Andes. The Andrea species is a wild plant in short supply due to the altitude and limited area in which it grows, and can only be picked during the months of December and January. The plants gathered undergo a very exacting selection process in which only seven percent are chosen. This process ends between March and April and only then is it known how many units of EIGHT & BOB can be bottled for the year.A fragrance with a history, EIGHT & BOB is a true perfume event. The bottle is hidden in a book, just as it was long ago."," Citrus, spice accord, violet, iris, cedar, sandalwood, gaiac, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anyway Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," A simple and original formula. Just fifteen ingredients, going right back to basics, only keeping the best. A blend of musks, woods and citrus notes... come together in a bright, subtle and persistent trail.  Far from an anonymous scent“Anyway” is a signature fragrance, ready to unite with the feminine as much as the masculine."," Green Lime Essence, Neroli Essence, Jasmine Absolute, Ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Garamante Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Leather can be many things – stern military boots, a worn-in saddle, a comfy chair. Cuir Garamante is a leather jacket – thick but supple – worn by a mysterious man who travels the world for reasons he keeps to himself. Journalist? Jewel thief? Spy? This is a jacket that has been to spice bazaars and state dinners and secret parties. It has snuck into palaces and jumped out of planes and hidden in opium dens. The opening has a tantalizing spiciness swirled with a swoony, boozy sweetness. Rich saffron, delicious nutmeg and sultry rose pave the way for the luxurious leather that is the central player. Although this leather does have the creamy aspect we love, it also has simmering animalic sensuality. It's a little bit rough, a little bit dirty and deeply sexy. Oud-like incense and sharp papyrus heighten the edgier qualities, while vanilla and sandalwood add a luscious warmth and smoothness. Weaving in and out is labdanum – smoky, sweetly resinous and mesmerizing. Addictive and fiendishly attractive – this is an outstanding interpretation of leather, one of our favorite notes."," Pink pepper, nutmeg, saffron, rose, oud accord, papyrus, leather, vanilla, labdanum, incense, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY," What's black? Pepper, lapsang souchong tea, birch tar... even tree moss can bring a lacquered black vibe to a scent. Black Play leans towards the fougÃ¨re, but with an intriguing, salty twist that can almost be tasted, and a metallic, rosy undercurrent.  A very light powdery effect conjured by the tree moss and violet turns these dusky accords into the deep matte velvet of a black swallowtail wing. A little more on the masculine side, but then, women have been known to dabble."," Black pepper, pepperwood, red pepper, violet, thyme, black tea, birch tar, incense, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thirty Three Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo," Thirty-three is a fragrance crafted from very special ingredients. The soul of the fragrance is built around a vintage oud - distilled in 1980 and aged until its release in 2013. It is also the only modern perfume to use a significant amount of wild-harvested Chinese oud oil and natural Chinese rose oil to build the scent profile. Contrary to most ouds however, Thirty-three is a surprisingly soft and velvety fragrance, and genuinely fits in an innovative space in terms of the wider oud category. Thirty-three is a deep and dark unisex fragrance, with dry and cold facets."," Soft black pepper, Candied mandarin, Caoutchouc, Chinese white tea, Chinese rose, Taif rose, Orris, Damascus steel, Rare, natural vintage ouds, Aged patchouli, Heliotropin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," What does black mean to you? Is it the darkened room in which you dream, the glistening menace of a panther's fur, the nervous stab of a blot of ink? What do you think black smells like? The smoking screech of a rubber tire, the rainbow shimmer of an oil slick, the sweaty leather of a rebel?Here is what Black smells like. An aura of spice and incense in a darkened temple, lit only by smoldering candles, surrounds you as you reach a deep meditative state. As you drift, your thoughts lead you to a place of comfort and serenity. Embrace the aroma: it is your father's scratchy beard and the scent of his pipe. It is your mother's silky hair, freshly washed. It is the fur of your most beloved pet. Fall deeper, into the womb, into the tomb, farther. It is the smolder of creation, the hiss of the first rain on hot stone. It is carbon and coal and smoke and fire. It is the deep roots of life.Puredistance Black plays hide-and-seek on skin, appearing, morphing, and reappearing to delight the senses. There is not a notes list for Black. Jan Ewoud Vos of Puredistance invites us to“Envision. Smell. Feel. Don't analyze.”",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ardent Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," Ardent is a captivating fragrance inspired by sweet depths of the earth and peppered with delectable floral notes. The combination of such natural rarities creates a delicate, yet rich scent reminiscent of humid seductive evenings in a far exotic land.The top notes open with theatrical anticipation and dazzle on the skin; plucky saffron mingles with coriander before being softened by creamy, elegant Turkish rose. The middle of this scent only intensifÃ¬es our lust for luxury, as Rose Absolute and Jasmine take on a sumptuous role arresting the wearer with their heady warmth. Ardent's base gently simmers us, bring us down to earth, the subtle use of argarwood anchors the fragrance masterfully, while the benzion and amber ensure a seductive drydown.Ardent is a fragrance full of romantic drama - indulging the senses from beginning to end."," Coriander, Carrot Seed, Saffron, Turkish Rose, Rose Absolute, Hedione, Beeswax, Benzoin, Vanilla, Cistus Labdanum, Argarwood, Patchouli, Musk, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sugi Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle," Sugi – also known as Japanese cedar – is popular as an ornamental plant in Japan and has a delicate, clean and energising fragrance. After the great success of our first collaborations with Comme des GarÃ§ons – Hinoki and Laurel – we've returned to them for this third scent, which has been developed in Paris by Antoine Maisondieu and comes in a Monocle-designed bottle and box. It's a refreshing unisex scent that's light but sophisticated, beginning with top notes of Mediterranean cypress and pepper from Madagascar, followed by iris from Florence and cedar from Virginia, and finished with pine and Haitian vetiver."," Mediterranean cypress, Madagascar pepper, Iris, Cedar, Pine, Haitian Vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY," What's red? A cherry. But Antoine Maisondieu didn't want to resort to the usual tricks of the trade, so he conjured it from a quality of Tolu balsam with a cherry facet, added safraleine for shine – and a leather effect that keeps the sweetness in check --, a drop of red mandarin for sweet juiciness as well as osmanthus and myrrh for their fruity effects. The heart burns like a cinnamon candy, freshened with geranium. This cheery cherry is a totally new interpretation of the note, without a drop of added sugar: it takes the“tart” out of the pie, sticks it back in the tree, and is guaranteed to raise the big goofy grin you'd get if you were a kid let loose on an orchard."," Red mandarin, pink peppercorn, Safraleine, red cherry accord, geranium, cinnamon, osmanthus, myrrh, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Green Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY," What's green? Mint, lime, basil... Green Play opens with a sap-filled burst of the former, the“nanah” used in Moroccan mint tea, a sweet variety with a slight absinth facet, churned into a sparkling fresh brew by lime and juniper berry, with green apple effects. Mastic (also known as lentisque) intensifies the greenness while also adding a soft balsamic note, blending with the vegetal musk of ambrette to keep the mint's exuberance in check. Vetiver takes the scent from the leaves to the roots. This huge whoosh of feel-good green is bottled energy. We defy you to take a whiff and not rush out to play."," Nanah mint, lime, juniper berry, basil, jasmine, mastic, ambrette, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Laurel Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle," Lebanon has been popping up on the radar as one of the hippest travel destinations on the planet,   and it's no wonder the two trend-setters who already teamed up for the best-selling Hinoki,   Comme des GarÃ§ons and Monocle magazine,   found  inspiration in the Country of the Cedars for their Scent Two.“We wanted to capture the same smell and sensation enjoyed while staying with friends in Batroun,   Lebanon. It's warm,   inviting and at times a little sharp – just like the country,  ” says Monocle editor in chief,  Tyler BrûlÃ©.Cedar,   then,   obviously,   tinged with incense – after all,  “Lebanon” and“olibanum”,   another name for frankincense,   share the same etymology – and the namesake laurel (the antiseptic laurel bay essential oil is used in Lebanon to make the traditional,   olive-oil based Alep soap). A dash of herbs sprinkled with pepper on a warm amber base infuse Laurel with a dry,   bracing aroma that redefines the very notion of freshness perfumery. A stunning achievement."," Laurel, pepper, cedar, patchouli, incense, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hinoki Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle," Hinoki takes its name from the hinoki cypress, a tree that only grows in Japan and is the preferred wood for building palaces, temples, shrines and the finest wooden soaking baths.  It was inspired by a visit to Tawaraya, a famous three-centuries-old traditional Japanese inn located in Kyoto.  Soaking in the legendary open-air hinoki ofuro (wooden bath) filled with warm spring water on a chilly morning, the idea for the perfume was born and the result is breathtaking.  The ofuro is captured perfectly: the full, rich scent of the wood, the smells of the surrounding greenery, the soft touch of meditative incense, the memories of native moss.  Hinoki is a dry,  woody-fresh scent with an intangible ”something” that gives it a mystical edge and the ability, much like CdG's Incense Series, to conjure the exact emotion and feel of the idea behind its creation and name."," Cypress, turpentine, camphor, cedar, thyme, pine, Georgian wood, frankincense, moss and vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Wood Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends. Today, not only has Oud Wood become one of the brand's classics, but it has spawned the brand-new“Oud Collection”, built around the original's core accord of oud, sandalwood and patchouli.Oud Wood's packaging may have changed, but fear not: you'll find the same powerful blend of cool spices and smoky woods, softened with a hint of vanilla and tonka bean. The daunting, medicinal and overly animalic facets of oud are toned down, translating the precious agarwood into a darkly elegant element of the perfumer's palette rather than a full-on French-Arabian extravaganza. As chic, urbane and sharply-cut as Mr. Ford's James Bond suits in Skyfall. And just as much of a sexy beast as Daniel Craig."," Oud, Chinese pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood Atlas, vanilla, tonka bean Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Oud Wood by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Tobacco Oud Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends with Oud Wood.Along with the latter and Oud Fleur, Tobacco Oud is part of the brand-new“Oud Collection”.  And in case you were wondering, any resemblance with Tobacco Vanille – a firm favorite in the Private Blends – is most emphatically not coincidental, since Tobacco Oud was composed by the very same perfumer, Olivier Gillotin. Here, the vanilla is ousted by – obviously – oud. The tobacco accord is less of a mellow pipe tobacco though it retains the delectable almondy inflection of tonka. Instead, it was inspired by“dokha”, a traditional“blend of herbs, flowers and spice-laden tobacco”. And a heady blend it is, matching the fragrant smokes of oud resin and aromatic tobacco, with none of the side effects...If you've been hankering for a darker, sultrier, woodier version of Tobacco Vanille, or like to tame your oud with a touch of sweetness, a whiff of this might turn your head: it's one of Mr. Ford's most addictive offerings to date."," Oud, tobacco dust absolute, coriander, cistus, labdanum, cedarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, roasted organic tonka bean, castoreum Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Tobacco Oud by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Fate Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," In the final creation that expresses the end of the first cycle of the Amouage narrative,“Fate” for man and woman explores the uncertainty of the future and the universal principal by which the order of things is inescapably prescribed. The immutable fragrances are presented in Amouage's iconic clear glass-crystal bottles with a rainbow undertone with gold plated caps accented with an aurora borealis inspired Swarovski crystal.Fate Man is one of those rare perfumes where you just have to try it to understand it. It begins with an opening salvo of absinthe and herbs through a heart of immortelle swathed in the most luxurious frankincense. The wheel of fortune that is Fate Man ends up on cedar and licorice to bring this stunning perfume to a close. Despite being labeled as masculine, Fate Man is a true shared fragrance and if you are a fan of Amouage-- this is a must try. Fate Man is as ever-changing as the swirling colors on the rainbow coated flacon; the experience is slightly altered every time you wear it."," Mandarin, saffron, absinth, ginger, cumin, everlasting flower, rose, frankincense, lavandin, cistus, copahu, labdanum, cedarwood, liquorice, tonka bean, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41847.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fate Woman,Amouage," Awarded 5 Stars (Masterpiece) by Luca Turin”œHow time flies. It seems only yesterday (actually five full years) that Christopher Chong took over Amouage's art direction and propelled this Omani firm, then known chiefly for its classic no-expense-spared Gold, into the first rank of perfumery. Chong is that rare bird, a natural perfumery art-director, who knows what he wants and will not give up until he finally smells it. In a recent interview with Style.com/Arabia, he said that Fate was a loud fragrance, so one expects a massively-built monster like the wonderful Ubar reissue in 2009. The surprise begins with the first puff from the spray: a fresh, radiant, powdery advance guard briefly fills the room. Seconds later, you are faced with one of the most intricate and beguiling fragrances in years. Nothing this big, complex and beautiful has been done since the first Boucheron. Though the top has a Guerlain-like appetizing feel, Fate borrows its core from Opium, i.e., woody-balsamic with an emphatic dose of the cool minty note that separates it from the merely warm, dusky Cabochard-Cinnabar style. Opium's virtue was its novel, instantly recognizable tune, of which we eventually tired. But don't let the reference put you off. Fate is to Opium what Mitsouko was to Coty's Chypre: a transfiguration. The central structure is deep in there, now cloaked in a cloud of radiant dust borrowed from the unstructured opulence of Gold, plus””a brilliant touch””a dry, fresh cigar-box cedar note to guard against excessive sweetness. Loud? Possibly, but comfortably so, without harshness or distortion. Like very few fragrances, Fate delivers the rush of physical glee you get when you sit in the front row of the stalls and a great orchestra begins to play. Just don't wear it to supper.” – Luca Turin, Style.com/Arabia"," Bergamot, cinnamon, chilli, pepper, rose, narcissus, jasmine, frankincense, labdanum, vanilla bean, benzoin, castoreum, patchouli, oakmoss, leather.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41848.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nemer Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," Determined to source a rare and precious Oud for the heart of this exclusive scent, the Boadicea perfumers discovered Tiger Oud. The Tiger Oud name derives from the variegated heart wood of a tree. When the wood is cut, as if by magic, the stripes of a tiger appear. The heart note also provided inspiration for the name of this precious scent – Nemer being the Arabic word for Tiger. Tiger Oud is copper distilled and is beautifully fluid – ensuring Nemers' sense of indulgent luxury and unmistakable quality.The fragrance contains some of the worlds finest ingredients, including; Saffron, Turkish Rose, Jasmine absolute and Indonesian Patchouli. Nemer is exquisitely unique, constructed using traditional fragrance oils and blended with sensibility. Its rich creamy concentration oozes with decadence and charm, lingering on the skin with a sense of innate mysticism.The Nemer bottle is a physical representation of the premium quality of the fragrance juice. The shield and bottle top have been dipped in 24 carat gold. Nemer is a  celebration of strength, nobility and beauty."," Turkish Rose, Morrocan Rose, Saffron, Tiger Oud, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zagorsk Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," Built around a 14th century monastery, the Russian holy spot of Zagorsk lends its name to this fragrance. Zagorsk opens with a surge of crisp pine and cedar. At its heart is an almost clean feeling... like pinecones strewn on brand-new snow on a dark winter's eve. Pretty poetic, and so is Zagorsk. At the base is Russia's famous birch wood, but not smoky, just the memory of old, fragrant fires burned in an Orthodox church in the middle of a forest. Clear and clean with a touch of melancholy."," white incense, pine, pimento berries, violet, cedar, iris, hinoki wood, birch wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Avignon Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," Powerful and intense, Avignon evokes the medieval city in the south of France which surpassed Rome as the Catholic Church's power center in the 14th century. It's the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance. Beautiful, dark and mysterious, Avignon takes its place among the most talked about (and admired) of CdG's entire line."," Roman chamomile, cistus oil, elemi, incense, vanilla, patchouli, palisander, ambrette seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kyoto Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," For thousands of years, people around the world have burned incense to honor their ancestors, purify the air, worship deities, accompany rituals or merely for the pure enjoyment that incense brings. Kyoto is a spiritual journey to the serene temples of the city known as Heart of Japan. Dry and calm, the cedar note in Kyoto is evident, swirling with the earthy scents of spicy, smoky vetiver and the juniper-meets-evergreen aroma of cypress. Serene and earthbound, Kyoto's quiet power is never harsh; it's a meditative scent, bringing to mind relaxing in one of Kyoto's legendary rotenburo (outdoor hot spring baths) nestled among the legendary cypress trees."," incense, cypress oil, coffee, teak wood, vetiver, patchouli, amber, everlasting flower, Virginian cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jaisalmer Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," Named after the ancient desert city in India, Jaisalmer was inspired by the spices and woods that passed through its namesake trade route, linking India to Egypt. Throughout the Incense series, CdG took at least one element associated with the city/country from which each of the scents take their name; in Jaisalmer, prized Indian ebony is added to resinous guaiac hardwood at the base, while a healthy dose of spice comprises the opening. The opposing sweet spice and earthy wood nature of this incense is a perfect salute to the gorgeous culture amidst the harsh climate of Jaisalmer itself."," cardamom, incense, cinnamon, amber, benzoin, pimento, berries, guaiac wood (aka gaiac wood or saint wood), ebony",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ouarzazate Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense," The high Atlas mountain city of Ouarzazate (pronounced war-za-zat) in Morocco was the inspiration of this masterpiece. At its opening, a sweet, balsamic tang of labdanum absolute quickly followed by zesty pepper tickles your nose. As it warms on the skin, the softly herbal clary sage (for which Morocco's is hailed as among the finest in the world) blends with a now-calm pepper and nutmeg to make Ouarzazate a crossroads of perfectly blended, spiced incense of the Middle Eastern variety. We close our eyes and imagine we're in the cool, still interior of Ouarzazate's famous Kasbah."," incense, pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, wenge, musk, vanilla, labdanum absolute, Kashmir wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Lentisque Eau de Toilette,Phaedon," The green, resinous, woody scent of the Pistacia lentiscus, a tree that grows all around the Mediterranean, immediately conjures the Spanish or Corsican maquis. The perfumer has captured the aroma rising from its branches on rocky paths under the blazing Mediterranean sun. Here, lentiscus is used in two forms: the powerful green essential oil boosted by galbanum in the top notes, and the absolute, blended with cistus labdanum and dry woods in the heart. Their crackling, resinous facets are drawn into the drydown by two natural allies, vetiver and cedar, enhanced by a skin-loving cocktail of musks tinged with ambergris."," lentisque, galbanum, labdanum, woody notes, vetiver and cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tabac Rouge Eau de Parfum,Phaedon," Turkish Blend is a quintessentially Art Deco composition. Turkish tobacco absolute and incense make up the core accord, spare, dry and perfectly balanced. As in Tamara de Lempicka's paintings, the“color” palette is pared-down and vibrant: ginger, cinnamon and a lick of honey. In the base notes, musks, bolstered by warm, powdery Siam benzoin, blend the scent with your skin. Androgynous, stylized and luxurious."," ginger, cinnamon, honey, musk, powdery notes and benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rouge Avignon Eau de Parfum,Phaedon," A Gothic composition, as opulent and dark as the shadow of the Papal Palace looming over nations and centuries... The carmine red of the papal stole is conjured with a fleshy, spicy rose facetted by ylang-ylang and raspberry. In the heart notes, waxed woods, cocoa bean, black truffle and earthy smoky vetiver lure us into the private apartments of the Supreme Pontiff. Gilt moldings and religious ornaments glint in the firelight while gray tendrils of smoke rise from a censer burning sandalwood chips mixed with musk and amber."," raspberry, ylang-ylang, rose, cacao pod, hinoki wood, tuber, vetiver, sandalwood, musk and amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56611.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Phaedon," Built around the contrast between fresh and woody notes, Black Vetiver rises like a black cloud mixing smoky Java vetiver, tar fumes and lemon tree leaves. The perfume has added to this classic note the warm, mineral tinges of a subtle“tar” accord blending two exceptional materials: pimiento and Jamaican vetiver. A genuinely scent, bracing and elegant."," vetiver, lemon and pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lapis Philosophorum Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," Olivier Durbano's mineral-based fragrances have always been a labor of love, an attempt to synthesize the physical properties of his chosen inspiration with their deeper symbolic significance. With Lapis Philosophorum, Olivier has for the first time focused on an element not found in nature- the mythical Philosopher's Stone, legendary in the ancient world for its ability to change basic stone into gold- and the results are simply extraordinary.Lapis opens with an enticing, wine-laden burst of sweetness that is quickly tempered by Olivier's signature incense accord. Those familiar with Black Tourmaline will appreciate that warm, comforting embrace that keeps you sniffing for more. Truffle and menthol are unusual ingredients, and here they play out in a very subtle manner- truffle adds a creamy, ethereal element, while menthol, barely detectable, adds a liveliness to the composition that keeps it aloft. A rich base of opoponax, oakmoss and myrhh smooth the disparate edges while harkening to an ancient era where magic had yet to disappear from the world. Intoxicating, lively, and truly unique, Lapis Philosophorum is not so much a radical departure for Olivier Durbano, but rather the ultimate example of his ability to take unlikely ingredients and create pure magic."," Calamus, Juniper, Rum, White truffle, Grapefruit, Wine sediment, Oman frankincense, Mesquite, Ambergris, Menthol, Opoponax, Myrrh, Musk, Oak moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violette Fumee,Mona di Orio,"“With the creation of Violette FumÃ©e, Mona composed the melody of my favorite passions, memories and materials.With flirty florals like violet and rose fumed with pipe tobacco, the exquisite smoothness of cashmere and suede, and deep resinous undertones, this warmly smoldering scent evokes my sensorial love for luxury, and makes me feel, dream, travel and remember.Revved at the start, crisp, fresh notes of herbal lavender and sparkling bergamot pair with inky oakmoss and get a twist as the scent unfolds into the elegance of vetiver and clary sage.The shy violet and iconic rose develop into a powdery and gourmand fume and then ramp up as spicy and savory notes of aphrodisiac saffron and smoky bois de gaiac communicate with the florals and begin to ignite.The smoldering continues as resinous opoponax, myrrh, and musky cashmeran dive slowly into an intense velvety embrace.” ”” Jeroen Oude Sogtoen, Partner & Creative Director for Maison Mona di Orio."," Lavender, Bergamot, Oakmoss, Violet flowers and leaves, Turkish Rose, Vetiver, Clary Sage, Opoponax, Myrrh, Cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champaca Absolute Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Tom Ford's Champaca Absolute seems to glow from within with a mÃ©lange of warm fruit and floral notes that melt into a balsamic base. The Champaca flower has a soft, gentle, hard-to-place complexity, with notes of wood, spice, and mint. In Champaca Absolute, that note is combined with magnolia (with its delicate apricot facet), jasmine, and a marron glaÃ§Ã© accord (chestnuts candied and glazed in sugar syrup). Champaca combined with the fresh-yet-sensuous magnolia smells not only like flowers that have been kissed by the sun ”” their notes, as a result, warmed up and heightened ”” but it also has a natural, petals-just-stripped-from-the-flower ripeness, giving a momentary impression of crushed petals releasing a slightly tropical scent."," Tokaji wine, cognac, bergamot, magnolia champaca, orchid, violet, jasmine, vanilla, amber, sandalwood and marron glacÃ© Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Champaca Absolute by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Jasmin Rouge Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Jasmine is one of those perfume ingredients that can be played in many keys, depending on the pitch wanted ”” high, green and fresh, or low, indolic-dirty, and languid. Tom Ford's Jasmine Rouge/Private Label starts off like a fine glass of champagne, with a bubbly effervescence courtesy of an aldehyde-driven bergamot and mandarine. As it develops with piquante neroli, languid-to-tropical, waxy ylang-ylang, and warming, beguiling spices, Jasmine Rouge seems to explode into variations on jasmine's richness and lightness. Towards the end, balsamic notes of vanilla and amber combine with a subtle woodsy-leather accord to wrap sparkling jasmine in their warm embrace, like a leather jacket on top of delicate, bare shoulders."," Bergamot, mandarine, cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, ginger, clary, neroli, ylang-ylang, vanilla, leather, amber, wood Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Jasmin Rouge by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Neroli Portofino Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Like a bespoke white shirt, Neroli Portofino takes the classic, citrus-driven lightness of  the eau de cologne formula and amps up the quality of its ingredients and, as a result, their fit on the skin. It opens with a luscious burst of neroli and layers of citrus notes, including bergamot, lemon and pittosporum, with its heady, jasmine-and-orange blossom-like bouquet. It then accents this bouquet with green and dusky herbs, including rosemary and lavender. This burst of freshness is warmed by an understated woody and amber base. Neroli Portofino doesn't reinvent the eau de cologne wheel, but it does take it for a spin along the winding roads of the Italian Riviera."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lavender, myrtle, rosemary, Bitter orange, Egyptian jasmine, neroli, orange blossom water, pittosporum, woody amber accord, ambrette seeds, angelica root Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Neroli Portofino by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Noir de Noir Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Certain scents smell like the (olfactory) lights are out, and you're walking into a room trying to see what's inside it. In Tom Ford's dark rose scent Noir de Noir, as the name suggests, black is indeed the name of the game. But once you adjust your eyes, the rose and its handmaidens glimmer like rich jewels glowing in the dark. This inky, goth, midnight rose is cloaked with mantles of oud, amber, and camphory patchouli. Saffron and truffle notes create a soft veil around this darkness, with a hint of vanilla, and tree moss adds a little more texture in the base. Noir de Noir is for the night owls of the perfume world."," Saffron, truffle, rose, patchouli, tree moss, oud, vanilla Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Noir de Noir by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Santal Blush Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Don't let the“blush” in Tom Ford's Santal Blush perfume fool you into thinking this is a shy or retreating scent. It's more of an exploration of the multi-dimensionality of the buttery-beautiful sandalwood note.Like looking at a cross-section of cut wood with its repeating but differentiated rings, sniffing Tom Ford's Santal Blush provides an olfactory version of similar-but-different reverberating facets of sandalwood. It opens with a creamy, almost coconut-y and even fig-fruit richness. Bold Indian spices of cumin and cinnamon give Santal Blush a temporary hot-and-heavy feral energy. As carrot seeds and fenugreek add a vegetal, waxy depth, chic, sandalwood calls in its reinforcements: cedar and oud, softened by musk. Soft, spicy, creamy, and sexy, Santal Blush is more forward than its name."," Indian spices, cumin, cinnamon, carrot seeds, fenugreek, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, Australian sandalwood, cedar, benzoin, musk Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Santal Blush by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Aqua Vitae Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," It was one afternoon on Formentera, in the Balearic Islands, that the idea of Aqua Vitae came to my mind. Riding an old motorbike, taking it slowly in view of the extreme heat, the air on my face was deliciously cool. The sun intensified the fragrances of the nature around me. Aqua Vitae, the water of life, when life is quite simply beautiful, an extremely sensitive sensuality enveloped with an uncontained freshness. ”” Francis Kurkdjian Kurkdjian's gorgeous ode to a summer afternoon opens with a sparkling combination of Calabrian lemon and Sicilian mandarin, evoking the sensual fullness of“uncontained freshness.”  Dazzling Hedione adds with the warmth of the sun while waves of tonka bean and vanilla counter with a cooling breeze.In its final phase, Aqua Vitae softens to a sunkissed, sandy drydown. By no means is it a fresh dab of coppertone - no beachy coconut here, but rather a whisper of vanilla-sweetened guaiac lingering close to the skin. It's a gentle reminder of summer afternoon caught on the skin, still warm from the sun."," Lemon, mandarin, tonka bean, vanilla infusion, hedione and guaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Classical Eau de Parfum,Anat Fritz," Inspired by Berlin designer Anat Fritz's youthful memories of sun-drenched weekends in the countryside, Classical has long been that rare fragrance that evokes a near-universal sense of childhood. Now, having been reworked by one of Germany's most renowned noses (we're not supposed to tell), Classical has upped the ante, taking an already bright and comforting scent and rounding it out into a luminously nostalgic Eau de Parfum meant to take each wearer on their own unique journey.Just as before, Classical features three essential main ingredients. Wild lavender is still the beating heart of the fragrance, underpinned with rich cedarwood and gentle vetiver to evoke images of lush forests and rolling meadows full of children at play. In Anat's new reformulation, however, the Lavender is toned down, and complemented with the addition of creamy sandalwood--adding a blast of air and light, smoothing the edges into a shimmering composition that perfectly captures the ethereal beauty of a childhood memory- no matter where you grew up."," Lavender, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Java Blossom Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Java Blossom is by far the coolest and smoothest in the Xerjoff Oud Attars collection. It transports you to an ancient sanctuary in a sacred forest, where the oud has been around for centuries, and has seen everything there is to see. It has witnessed every flower blossom, and has chosen a clean soothing orange blossom along with a slightly smokey tuberose to compliment its unique timelessness. In this oud you won't find a dirty or salty note, just raw oud and a broad footprint of vetiver - earthy, green, and ancient."," Bergamot, Orange Blossom, Incense, Tuberose, Hindi Oud, Sandalwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Sukar Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Black Sukar is a truly unique take on oud, and the brightest and sweetest in the Xerjoff Oud Attars collection.  A juicy orange gives this oud scent a friendly presence, while slightly soapy freesia and peony lend an unexpected clean floral aspect to the blend.  The pink pepper and rose notes balance the slightly sugary quality of this scent, and while it may be light and sweet, the oud note is unmistakeable.  Black Sukar is perfect for an oud lover who wants to challenge the dark and dirty status quo."," Orange, Pink Pepper & Freesia, Damascus Rose, Peony, Vanilla, Laos Oud and White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Warda al Oud Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars," Warda Al Oud is not an oud scent for beginners, but it is remarkable one.  The floral notes in this scent deliver a heavy dose of indole, giving it a musky and salty animal quality that is not for the faint of heart.  Coupled with the indolic floral notes is an intoxicating and layered smokiness.  As the veil of smoke lifts you notice a sensuous bouquet of roses with a serious edge - no coy looks or twee manner from these flowers.  The progression of Warda Al Oud bears a layer of vanilla and amber that begin to sing on the skin, enveloping the entire composition in a seductive and mysterious embrace."," Bergamot, Jasmine, Bulgaria, Damascus Rose, Osmanthus, Vanilla, Amber, Musk, Cambodian Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

With 2 different types of oud, Oud Louban achieves a stunning depth, perfected by the note of Omani incense that rolls and wanders throughout the composition.  Black pepper grows more prominent as the scent develops on the skin, and the gorgeous floral notes of rose and orange blossom levitate the scent over a wild bed of vetiver."," Extract of Bulgarian Rose, Black Pepper, Orange Blossom, Cambodi Oud, Hindi Oud, Cedar Wood, Omani Incense, Vetyver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jeke Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse," Jeke is a tobacco based fragrance with ornaments of spice, smoke and sweetness. Its heart is a rich accord of tobacco absolutes (Bulgarian, French and Spanish) paired with bourbon vanilla absolute and honey to create a sweet, milky tobacco base. The smoke and spice are constructed in a way to evoke the feeling of desolate autumn nights - the sting of smoke and the spice of burning leaves drifting through the cold black air."," Tobacco, vanilla, smoke, labdanum, patchouli, honey, clove",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Norne Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse," Few locations on earth bridge the gap between the terrestrial and the supernatural like the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Dominated by towering old-growth trees, shrouded in fog and deciduous shadow, these forests represent the few remaining places where mankind's dominion over the planet is far from absolute, and the wisdom of nature still supersedes the passing concerns of civilization. With Norne, Slumberhouse aims to capture the essence of this mystical place, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary.One glance of the ominously beautiful bright-black liquid makes it clear that Norne is far from a typical natural fragrance, and with the first powerful blast of fresh, resinous fir, it's confirmed. As the scent develops, other deeply complex woodland elements emerge: green moss, earthy fungus, fog, and a touch of slightly sweet incense that evokes images of a roaring campfire cutting through the damp air. While the clarity and strength of these notes is almost hard to believe, the explanation is simple: Norne is made with 100% forest absolutes, a complicated and costly process that avoids synthetics and essential oils in favor of natural, powerful ingredients. The result is a fragrance of unparalleled potency and depth, entirely suited to its subject. For lovers of the outdoors, fragrance enthusiasts in search of the  truly unique, or anyone with a love for the ethereal, Norne is not to be missed."," Fog caked needle, lichen, fern, moss, hemlock, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ore Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse," Gourmand fragrances aren't supposed to be dangerous, but nobody seems to have told Slumberhouse. That's good news for all of us, because Ore, with its sensuous heart of dry cocoa, lactonic balsams and dark wood, makes us think more of the bedroom than the dinner table. From the first smell of tantalizingly complex dry cocoa, it's evident that Ore has no intention of following in the footsteps of a typical gourmand. This is a rich, raw cacao note that blends seamlessly into the dark guaiac and oakwood to evoke the kind of sensual decadence that has nothing to do with the calorie count. A boozy caramel delivers enough warmth to bring a comforting balance to the mystery and provides a backdrop for the creamy balsam that's quickly becoming creator Josh Lobb's signature. No matter how you feel about traditional gourmands, one smell of Ore will be more than enough to make you hope that Slumberhouse never stops breaking the rules."," Oakwood, cocoa, mahogany, guaiac, dittany of crete (oregano), vanilla, whiskey lactone, peru resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
40 Knots Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club," No ordinary aquatic, 40 Knots captures the essence of the famous Italian yacht club and the Mediterranean air.  One of Xerjoff's signature traits is an uncanny ability to harmonize the most extreme intervals -- sparkling aquatic top notes in perfect balance with the deepest, darkest bases - like the sea itself with a sparkling surface and fathomless depth. 40 Knots opens with a sea breeze, warmed by sun-kissed, vegetal greens and cooled by the surface of the salty water. The bracing, nearly menthol, salt note ebbs and flows through the entire drydown, which gets darker, woodier, and richer with emerging notes of coffee, cedar, and clove. The crisp green and salty beginning softens to reveal a woody, slightly floral heart.  Yacht or no yacht, this aquatic stunner with its surprising depth will leave turning heads in your wake.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Comandante Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club," A fine cigar, like an exquisite fragrance, allows you the opportunity to momentarily step away from the routine of everyday life and savor the nuance of an extraordinary sensory experience. With Comandante, Xerjoff captures not only the essence of a perfectly crafted cigar, but also the ritual that goes with it, resulting in a meditative fragrance that's sure to whisk away your cares like smoke on the wind.Comandante opens with the slight sweetness of an expensive cigar before the match is ever struck: cherry, spicy fruit and a distinct note of honey hint at the complexity that awaits. As the metaphorical smoke begins to waft, the tobacco asserts itself, cloaked in leather and a rich amber that together convey a patient, dignified introspection. Throughout it all, a wonderfully soapy iris keeps Comandante from ever falling into a typical barbershop scent and reminds us that the most exclusive clubs choose the most deserving men and women alike. It's not always easy to find a spare moment to appreciate a truly fine cigar, but with Comandante, it's only a deep breath away.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63205.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
More than Words Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club," As Xerjoff's homage to literature and poetry, More Than Words is proof that the greatest phrases often come from unexpected combinations.  Part sumptuous fruity floral, part complex resin-drenched oriental, More Than Words achieves true poetic balance with a composition that celebrates the individuality of its disparate elements without ever sacrificing the captivating blend of the whole fragrance.While an intoxicating accord of sweet fruit dominates the opening of More Than Words, it also indicates the unpredictability to come, with individual moments of smoky labdanum and wood creeping in just enough to surprise and enchant. As the sweetness dries, the fragrance bounds further into exotic territory, with oud and benzoin providing a warm, sensual backdrop. A waxing and waning frankincense brings everything together with such natural precision that it's easy to forget how bold the whole thing really is. Like all great writing, More Than Words is something more than the sum of its parts.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ivory Route Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club," This is Xerjoff's travel-themed fragrance from the“Join the Club” series. Trunks, maps, and the adrenaline of travel are interpreted in this adventurous composition through a blend of spices, smoke and wood that is both exotic and comforting.  Sweet aromatic herbs mix with spice for a fresh, almost mentholated start. Smokey birch tar and Lapsong tea linger at Ivory Route's heart, until woody, ambery vanilla and patchouli base notes rise to the surface in the dry down. For its exotic and glamorous profile, Ivory Route is surprisingly refined and restrained. It possesses a mysterious antique richness, and its gentle heart seems to keep in mind the delicacy with which real ivory must be handled.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63208.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intense Cafe Eau de Parfum,Montale," Do you ever find yourself lingering in the coffee aisle at the grocery store? Taking in deep breaths by the grinder? You're not alone. There may be no smell more comforting and compelling than the bitter, deep, mouthwatering fragrance of the coffee bean. Montale's Intense Cafe opens with a perfect waft of fresh brewing coffee that will take your breath away. The flourish of coffee bean is paired with a fresh, vegetal rose. The two combine for an unexpectedly dry and refreshing top note. As the coffee softens, a vanillic white musk emerges, slightly sweetening the brew with just a hint of cream and sugar. Even in the final ambery drydown the coffee remains as a rich and nutty presence. This addictive and surprising gourmand is suitable for both men and women, and is the perfect fix for the coffee addict in all of us."," Coffee, rose, amber, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35448.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Playing with the Devil Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Playing with the Devil is the fourth edition in Kilian's series of tributes to forbidden fruits. Here, as with the rest of the series, he uses the concept of good & evil as inspiration for a modern fruit-led composition. And as with the three previous scents in the series, naughty always wins out. The nectar freshness of lychee and the crispness of white peach playfully engage black pepper and pimento. The effect is a top with both a flirty tartness and a soft, powdery gauziness. All the crispness in the opening eventually gives way to a woody floral heart, wherein May Rose and jasmine Sambac soften earthy wood notes of cedar, Sandalwood and patchouli.  The rich, woody heart grows softer, even more powdery, and increasingly sensual as it dries down into its final animalic-tinged oriental base of tonka, benzoin and vanilla.Whatever games Kilian and perfumer Calice Becker were intending to evoke in Playing with the Devil, it seems the fun takes a delightful turn for the risquÃ© - perhaps like a seemingly innocuous game of Truth or Dare. It never fully abandons its freshness, and never gets too dark or dirty, but rather hints at a sensuality that every girl (good or bad) would want in her scent arsenal."," Blood orange, black currant, white peach, lychee, pepper, pimento, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, rose, jasmine, tonka, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42570.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Coccobello Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," Coccobello is truly intriguing and not your typical beach scent.  It is at once creamy and green, sweet and fresh, classic and cutting edge.  Think glamorous high-fashion resort wear spread in Vogue mixed with the lush and colorful tropical paintings of Henri Rousseau.  We know - it's that good.  Coccobello begins slightly green with wafts of palm leaves, cedar, and watery coconut.  While it remains a nice scent on paper, Coccobello absolutely comes to life on skin and works some kind of magic that we're still trying to figure out.  The benzoin, vanilla, and gardenia start a party that might end up with someone getting bitten, and something like mango butter makes an unexpected cameo.  The scent projects into a gorgeous, creamy, and slightly fruity veil of scent that lifts you away onto the perfect tropical beach vignette:  the breeze whispering through the palm trees, a cold drink in your hand, salt water dripping onto your towel, and nearby gardenias blooming with abandon.  This may be the best vacation you've ever taken."," Palm Leaves, Gardenia, Coconut, Sea Salt, Vanilla Bourbon, Virgina Cedar, Sandalwood, Benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1899 - Ernest Hemingway Eau de Parfum,Histoires de Parfums," Born on the edge of a century that changed the world order, Ernest Hemingway was involved in the u-turn events of his era. From USA to Spain, from Italy, then Paris to Cuba, Hemingway's journeys tell a lot about his convictions.Founder of a new genre, his writings depicted a new vision of the world, mixing reality and fiction. Intellectual and activist, compromise was none of his kind, as Hemingway always succeed in finding his own way, and thus, his unique style.Hemingway's passion was captured in this fragrance. From soldier, to adventurer, journalist and at last writer, his brilliant route invites us to travel, imagine and move to action. This is a tribute to a vibrant and raw man.GÃ©rald Ghislain, created an oneiric scent for 1899. The top notes of Italian bergamot, juniper and pepper are intended to be the aperitif that sparks the conversation and awakens the palate in anticipation of the meal. Following Papa from Spain to Italy with Mediterranean scents that evaporate to leave place to a darker mood, where the amber and vetiver mixed is reminiscent of the waxed wood of a Cuban bar top. The exotic meets the familiar, the tropical heat is cooled off by a glass of scotch."," Italian bergamot, juniper, black pepper, Orange blossom, Florentine Iris, Cinammon, Vanilla, Vetiver, yellow amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Standard Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Artek," After Monocle, Stephen Jones and Daphne Guinness, Comme des GarÃ§ons partners up with the cult Finnish design company Artek, founded by Alvar Aalto, to launch a fragrance with a distinctly Boreal flavor. Comme des GarÃ§ons' trademark“anti-perfume” notes – in this case, a hint of metallic tang bolstering the lemon-ginger opening – blended with two seldom-used materials gathered in the Great North: Finnish Labrador Tea (also known as Indian Tea), extracted from a fir-smelling evergreen shrub, and twinflower, an almond-tinged blossom from the honeysuckle family. The overall effect, however, is unmistakably Comme des GarÃ§ons: a medicinal-woody scent, vibrant with the combustible, pencil-shaving fumes of cedar and a cold, almost incense-like effect. Highly diffusive, totally distinctive and as elegantly pared-down as Alvar Aalto's iconic Mid-century Modern designs. You can't get edgier than that."," Finnish Labrador Tea, Twinflower (Linnea Borealis), fennel, ginger, lemon, musk, saffron, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Almost Transparent Blue Eau de Toilette,A Lab on Fire," Almost Transparent Blue takes the classic elements of cologne and tweaks them to create a futuristic urban citrus, with hints of pavement and ink. The yuzu and lime in the opening are beautifully crystalline and sharply realistic, and the citrus stays crisp and sparkling as the scent evolves.  A brisk, hyper-real soap note emerges, with subtle hints of something industrial underneath. This has the stark feel of an abandoned city – a landscape carved in glass and steel, spare and stripped clean and angular, with empty monorail tracks slicing through the sky.  The chilly aldehydes are countered by warm cedar and the dry and clarifying scent of hinoki, the prized cypress that grows only in Japan. Hinoki wood is used to make the finest soaking baths and it has a distinctive, incense-like scent – airy, but haunting. Our first impression of this was cool, clean and simple, but as we spend more time with it, we would strike the word simple. This ultramodern blend of citrus and wood has just enough strangeness to make it utterly compelling."," Lime, yuzu, thyme flower, aldehyde, hinoki, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rouge Assassin,Jovoy Paris," Two types of women from the Twenties mingle in the same space without ever really meeting: One is“la maitresse de ces messieurs”, a mistress in the tradition of the Second Empire and the“garÃ§onne”, a term for the emancipated woman, whose look may have been androgynous at times, but who Rouge Assassin pays tribute to those fearless, unstoppable women who upended the established order and broke all the rules. While the garÃ§onne look is sometimes considered masculine, femininity is what came through in the way women wore their hair and makeup, in their attitudes, their hunger for freedom and the insatiable desire to love without regard for social codes and conventions. She was the first in the history of women's fashion to reveal her legs. Soon, brassieres would replace corsets. Thick stockings vanished in favor of silk ones worn rolled over a garter above the knee. It was at this time that the first lipsticks appeared.The scent opens with the mysterious quality of both women's scents intermingling - sweet cigar smoke swirls and twirls in the dim light until it collides with a seductive cloud of powder.  Everything is in silhouette as the scent draws you in to explore its development -  the lipstick iris and saturated rose notes give way to a plush cushion of ambrette, vanilla, and benzoin.  The cedar note lends a kick of smoke that evokes a bewitching image - a pair of glossy red lips smoking a clove cigarette.Thanks to the collaboration of perfumer AmÃ©lie Bourgeois, Rouge Assassin is an homage to femininity that blends lipstick notes (iris butter), with the scent of skin (rice bran, musk, powdery floral accords) and echoes of Parisian cabarets. Men who wear it are either incurable risk-takers or they are Machiavellian schemers."," Bergamot, Fresh rose, elemi, solar accord, Iris, rice bran, ambrette seed, Virginia cedar, white musk, sandalwood, vanilla, Tonka bean, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Knize Forest Eau de Toilette,Knize," Knize Forest is green and at the same time soft and balmy. It has a contingent of bergamot. The heart is aromatic, spicy and a little woody on a base of ambergris and musk. Memories of the wide, green grassland of Ireland awaken in us.Knize was founded in Vienna in 1858. After the death of founder Joseph KniÅ¾e in 1880, his son Joseph Knize Jun took over the business. In 1888 KniÅ¾e received the coveted title of royal tailor to the Austro-Hungarian Court. By the turn of the century many personalities, heads of state, artists and industrialists belonged to the select group of Knize's customers."," Orange, Lemon, Petitgrain, Bergamot, Lavender, Rosemary, Sage, Oregano, Basil, Geranium, Rosewood, Carnation, Vetiver, Patchouly, Sandalwood, Ambergris, Labdanum (Rockrose), Oakmoss, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champaca Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Luxe," If heaven had a fragrance, we think it would smell like Champaca.  Named after the flower sacred to the Indus Valley, Champaca is a creamy and sweet floral that strikes perfect harmony between flower, perfumed wood and muted spice.  It's absolutely stunning and its velvety beauty truly makes us think of something wild and natural, a perfume that seems almost impossible to have been blended by a mere human.  Although the other notes in this perfume dance in and out, the holy champaca flower is and remains the exotic star of the perfume throughout, an endless dance of sweet, a soothing embrace of softness, and an otherworldly touch of something very, very rare.  The champaca flower forms one of the five flower arrows of Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love known in the Western world as Cupid.  One smell of this perfume and you'll know why we were smitten at first sniff, here now in an eau de toilette version!"," White pepper, angelica, cardamom, champaca, bird pepper, tuberose, white musk, iris wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/39602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acqua Decima Eau de Toilette,Eau d'Italie," Acqua Decima, as its name indicates in Italian, is the tenth fragrance in the Eau d'Italie collection. Born nearly ten years ago as a celebration of Hotel Le Sirenuse's 50th anniversary, Eau d'Italie has become a collection of fragrances that evokes Italy's many seductive faces: not only summer in Positano, but also the roses of Paestum, winter in Tuscany and Umbria, the spirit of Venice, magnolias in Rome, a garden in Sicily, Capri and la dolce vita on the Amalfi coast.Now Acqua Decima celebrates the spirit of Italy itself, with quintessentially Mediterranean sensations like the scented notes that greet us along The Path of the Gods, the spectacular mountain walk that links the Amalfi coast with the Bay of Sorrento, through cliffs in the wilderness over a glimmering blue sea. The gold of lemons and mandarins, the warmth of Neroli, the fresh coolness of petitgrain, enlivened by zesty notes of mint leaves. The result is a fragrance which from the very first notes inevitably brings a smile to one's face and the immediate good mood we feel when we recognize classic notes we love. Acqua Decima is the fragrance that reflects the sunniest feelings we have inside. Say hello to your perfect summer scent!"," Lemon, mandarine, mint leaves, neroli, petitgrain, hedione, white wood, vetiver.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orangers en Fleurs Eau de Parfum,Houbigant," The Orange Blossom is a symbol of fertility, of abundance””because Orange trees produce flowers and fruit at the same time””of innocence and marriage by excellence. It is also the emblem of love. It is an orange blossom note wrapped in a sophisticated perfume blend of Turkish rose absolute warmed by an animalistic note of Egyptian jasmine absolute.The body is a subtle blend of tuberose and Eau de Brouts absolute, an exclusive Robertet raw material, surrounded by the Ylang Comores essence and slightly spiced by Nutmeg. A cedar wood blend with a touch of musk completes the composition.Parfum Extract Luxe Edition??Parfum Extracts are the ultimate form of a perfume, they are more sophisticated, long lasting, and every facet is in greater harmony. The House of Houbigant has always believed the use of the extract is the best way to wear a fragrance. The Orangers en Fleurs perfume edition is showcased in a lavish handmade hardwood lacquered box, on which the logo has been carved."," Orange Blossom Absolute, Rose Absolute, Egyptian Jasmine Absolute, Tuberose, Eau de Brouts, Ylang Comores, Nutmeg, Cedar wood, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lys 41 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," A lavish, breathtaking, no-holds-barred big white floral that is drop-dead gorgeous.  While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage – jasmine and tuberose absolute.  They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room – creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat. In any configuration, you get a profusion of glowing white petals -- a soaring mix of the heady qualities of all three blooms -- warmed with gentle woods and a dreamy, cozy vanilla. While this is definitely not light in the sense of being understated, it is light in the sense of being airy and buoyant. It is an expansive airiness - a large billowy cloud of something weightless: rows and rows of ballerinas spinning in tutus, hundreds of white butterflies being released into the air, an impossibly long chiffon veil floating in the wind. Lys 41 is also filled with light – the bright white flowers have a brilliant luminosity which is burnished to a soft pearlescent sheen by the musk and vanilla.   The expectations are always high with Le Labo, and Lys 41, created in collaboration with one of Le Labo's iconic noses, DaphnÃ© Bugey, does not disappoint.  They have created the white floral that we wear in our dreams.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Ylang 49 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," A sumptuous floral chypre with all the moody charisma of a film noir. Like the scarlet-lipped femme fatale with a shadowy past, the enigmatic Ylang 49 starts as a thing of straightforward beauty before leading us down a winding, slightly dangerous path.Ylang 49 opens with a powerful burst of classic chypre elements – a sultry sweet floral heart of gardenia and ylang ylang, countering a pungently earthy patchouli and oakmoss. But just when you think you've got it figured out, the ylang ylang and gardenia meld into a lush, buttery, exotic floral with hints of apricot. The tension between the creamy flowers and dusky oakmoss creates a gingery fizz and the deep thrum of rich sandalwood and resinous benzoin generates a velvety sweetness that highlights the titular ingredient's peachlike aspect. In the center of all this swirling intrigue is a warm, salty skin note that feels both sensuous and modern, provocative yet comforting. Like the mysterious beauty from so many stories, Ylang 49 is not meant to flirt with everyone it meets, but instead to seduce only the worthy.Exquisite secrets like the ones contained in Ylang 49 simply cannot be limited to either men or women. The only requirements are boldness, complexity, and a thirst for the extraordinary.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Rose 31 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," A rose for men destined to be stolen by women, Rose 31 takes the most feminine of all notes, darkens, dries and spicies it up turning it into a veritable emblem of masculinity.  Mesmerizingly ambiguous, the fragrance alternates between the floral and the spicy with a generous dose of the woody and the animalic thrown in for good measure.  The striking, elegantly austere beginning of Rose 31 gives way to the sweet, spicy star note of rose accompanied by fiery spices, pepper, clove and nutmeg. The naughty hint of cumin in the heart of the scent is a prologue to the sensual base of oud and vetiver. Dark, dangerous and sublimely refined, this is one of our favorite Rose perfumes of all time.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Glorious Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," Housed in Boadicea's signature falcon, is Glorious, a celebration of difference inspired by the warrior Queen and her unflinching determination to succeed. The desire was to create a non conventional fruity floral scent that would intrigue and bewitch the wearer.Glorious surprises from the beginning with a hit of glossy, juicy accords loaded with playful mischief. Raspberry, plum and peach mingle on the skin with succulent delight, while apple and pineapple bring a sense of heavenly effervescence. As the fruity tones melt away, Glorious unravels like a fine wine, smooth and utterly divine. The heart of jasmine ensures the palpable feeling of luxury, while the use of cardamom and nutmeg convey the air of nonconformity that has become synonymous with Boadicea the Victorious.The dry presents a moody, more mature sentient, emerging with warmth and charm. The amalgamation of precious woods, including, cedar wood, sandalwood and patchouli add to the mystique of the perfume. The lick of vanilla and whisper of amber demonstrates a luscious finish to an altogether intoxicating scent. Glorious demonstrates the perfect balance of refinement and innovation."," Pineapple, Plum, Fresh, Elemi, Raspberry, Peach, Apple, Cardamom, Balsam, Jasmine, Nutmeg, Rose, Musk, Cedar Wood, Amber, Guaiac Wood, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Mossy",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mousse II Eau de Parfum,Oliver & Co.," Oliver & Co.'s handcrafted fragrances are an intensely personal labor of love; created drop by drop to ensure that the end result is as spontaneous as it is satisfying. And while any other perfumer might be justifiably wary of tinkering with the unexpected balance of warm spice and cool musk that makes up the original MOUSSE, Oliver Valverde is not any other perfumer. The result is MOUSSE II, a thrilling reinvention that plays like a virtuosic take on a jazz standard, adding invigorating new depth to a familiar favorite.  Like its predecessor, MOUSSE II opens with the spicy warmth of clove against a strong backbone of sandalwood and oak moss. But while the original took its time to slowly develop its cool aldehyde and musk counterbalance, MOUSSE II ups the ante with a powerful blast of mint that immediately ties spicy and fresh together. As the fragrance dries on the skin, notes of lily of the valley and Mexican lime weave together for a rich, bright green that blends vitality and lightness with the ever present warmth of clove without a hint of contradiction. Many fragrances claim to offer perfect balance, but very few manage to pull it off with such creative panache. With MOUSSE II, Oliver & Co. stands alone.This perfume is a re-envisioning of the original Mousse eau de toilette that was originally released in 2011."," Sandalwood Mysore, clove bud Madagascar, lavender absolute, lime peel from Mexico, mint, aldehydes, cardamom Guatemala, musk, ambergris, muguet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Resina Eau de Parfum,Oliver & Co.," To say that a fragrance has the power to transport implies a strong sense of place; the salty ocean, the lush forest, a flower-filled meadow. Oliver & Co.'s hypnotic Resina, on the other hand, transports the wearer not only to a different place, but also to a different time, a sultry and mystical forest of the ancients where the miraculous is commonplace, and beauty and wisdom are inextricably intertwined. Opening with an attention-catching burst of ginger and star anise, Resina quickly fills out with an opulent accord of precious woods and resins: tolu balsalm, elemi, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum. A subtle undercurrent of coffee and jasmine only furthers the sensation of exploring an earthy, mist-filled forest, brimming with ancestral knowledge. Spicy without a hint of stuffiness, rich and woody while not the least bit sweet, Resina reveals her secrets only to those who can prove themselves truly worthy."," Tolu balsam, elemi Philippines, myrrh, labdanum Spain, opopanax, frankincense Somalia, benzoin Siam, coffee co2 extract, jasmine sambac, Australian fire tree, rooibos tincture, macis, tonka bean Venezuela, fir balsam, ginger, star anise.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiverus Eau de parfum,Oliver & Co.," If you love the pure, smoky sexiness of vetiver the way we do, it can be frustrating to try fragrances that hide it behind other powerful ingredients in the name of“balance.” Vetiverus most certainly does not have this problem. By selecting complementary notes that almost entirely accentuate and highlight the sweet earthiness of the namesake ingredient, Oliver & Co. have bucked tradition yet again with that rare vetiver fragrance that proudly refuses to apologize for being a vetiver. In keeping with this philosophy, Vetiverus opens dramatically with an exquisitely deep and mysterious vetiver, at once smoky and velvety rich, reminiscent of Les Nez's cult classic Turtle Vetiver Exercise 1. And rather than undercut that raw power, Vetiverus goes all in, with labdanum, leather, patchouli and clove serving to reinforce and extend the natural depth and warmth. A base of musk keeps everything standing upright, while the subtle sweetness of osmanthus flowers provides rich smoothness. Plenty of great fragrances feature vetiver. But for the true vetiver enthusiast searching for an unapologetic, uncompromising showcase of the sublimely smoky, there is perhaps no substitute for Vetiverus."," Labdanum, styrax, vetiver, ambergris, osmanthus flower, orange peel, patchouly, musk, coriander seed, clove bud.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya," Remember when Rossano Brazzi sang“Some Enchanted Evening, ” how he fell in love across a crowded room on a tropical Island? If you've ever want to be that girl that stops the party,  this bold debut from Victoria Minya is your next must-have. The hedonist who wears this intoxicatingly sweet floral,  loaded with ripe peaches and rum extract,  is unquestionable a pleasure-seaker,  but she also a lady. She's the center of attention without raising her voice.  She enters and heads turn. In this perfect orchestration,  peach melds with vanilla,  osmanthus,  jasmine and soft tobacco in a classic example of feminine flirtation,  a beguiling expression of skin that wants to be touched.  In presentation as well,  the fragrance captivates. The handmade wooden box opens to reveal a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of Bohemian crystals that sparkle  in the champagne colored liquid. Strikingly sensuous,  wearing this will make you feel gorgeous,  confident,  and undeniably enchanting."," Rum, bergamot, peach, osmanthus absolute, jasmine abolute, orange flower absolute, tobacco, vanilla, cedarwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bay Rum Cologne,Gilbert Henry," This cologne is made with the same great essential oil blend as the corresponding Bay Rum aftershave balm, but at a higher concentration.  This is a Bay Rum that lasts.  Not because of sheer strength, but because each essential oil was carefully selected to enhance the characteristics of its key ingredient, essential oil of Bay Rum (pimenta racemosa).  The bay rum is blended with citrus and ylang ylang to bring out a bit of sweetness, a touch of clove for added spice, and a base of exotic sandalwoods for warmth and increased longevity of the fragrance."," Bay rum, citrus, ylang ylang, clove, exotic sandalwoods.

Gold Rose Oudh Extrait de Parfum,Tiziana Terenzi," Barefoot amidst the charm and mystery of fire in a desert camp.  The warm, sensual notes of a strange night in the wilderness; the soothing spicy fragrance; the evocative power of roses; and the ancestral and reassuring perfume of honey; all of them are celebrated in the power of the flame.Tiziana Terenzi makes her debut with four Extrait de Parfum dedicated to the remembrance of fire.  Precious and refined extracts of an endless journey."," Bergamot, Fir, Ember, Sand accord, Rose, Patchouli, Black Pepper, Oudh, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk, Honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Les Jeux Sont Faits Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," In the 1960s,  a particular kind of rogue flourished in French cinema, exemplified by actors Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura. Their natural habitat was the smoky gambling den, the atmosphere thick with vice and retro masculinity. With Jovoy's woody aromatic perfume Les Jeux Sont Faits (”œThe Bets Have Been Placed”), FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin wanted to pay homage to those louche and romantic icons that marked an era. English gin clinking in a tumbler with ice ”” aromatic, fresh, and cold ”” is evoked by the astringent herb angelica as Les Jeux Sont Faits sounds its first notes. Its juniper-like sharpness gives way to accords that recall the woodwork, leather chairs, and gaming men in clandestine gambling clubs: tobacco leaves, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli and leather. To offset these olfactory signifiers of masculinity is a warm and fruity accord rounded off by vanilla and labdanum, which also recalls Old Cuban rums.As it dries down, Les Jeux Sont Faits' balance of herby petitgrain, boozy accords, woods and spice warmed with vanillic notes makes for one sexy scent you can bet on: this one's a winner."," Petitgrain, angelica, dried fruits, rum, gin, tobacco leaf, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Coal Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," Andrea Maack's Coal fragrance is based on one of her original drawings made with black coal. Created with perfumer Richard Ibanez at Robertet, he tried to re-transcribe the smell and the atmosphere of an artists' studio when the artist is using black coal. Composed with dark and warm raw materials and fresh and vibrating ones, this eau de parfum shows the warm/cold contrast that black coal can have."," Sichuan pepper, pink pepper, juniper berry, cedar wood, papyrus, coal accord, sandalwood, patchouli and leather.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gothic II - Perfume Oil Roll-on perfume oil,Loree Rodkin," A dark and brooding blend of rare woods and patchouli laced with hypnotic incense and ravishing vanilla. The melancholy of old stone walls and the richness of ancient tapestry. Shadows and whispers and held glances. The troubling thrill of obsession.

Private Label Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," If there were a dimmer switch on a perfume's notes, allowing you to turn the lights down and saturate its colors, perfumer CÃ©cile Zaroakian has used it with Private Label. Connoisseurs of leather scents will want to flock to this brooding yet seductive perfume. A vetiver leather dosed with patchouli and papyrus sedge, followed by a creamy, woodsy base, Private Label is bone dry and only lightly sweetened yet soft and seductive. Papyrus sedge adds a kind of vegetal bitterness to the already challenging and austere vetiver/leather combination. This formidable accord is balanced by the rich, buttery base of sandalwood and vanillic labdanum (cistus). Described by Jovoy FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin as his ideal Oriental scent, he continues that it is“the archetypal parfum de sillage: it leaves a distinct trail while remaining consistent over time.” Earthy, elegant, and stunning, Private Label is sure to appeal to vetiver and leather lovers, as well as any perfumista who wants to walk on the dark side."," Papyrus, vetiver, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, Cistus labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Liturgie des Heures Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," Combining the sacred and the profane, La Liturgie des Heures opens the doors of an old country cathedral, infusing the scent of burning incense with lush forest greens. The fragrant, smoky aridity of incense balanced by the rich verdancy of cypress, creates a scent at once voluptuous, mysterious, and meditative. Liturgy of the Hours' warm, resinous base embraces its incense and aromatic greens, softening their intensity and adding an element of seduction."," Cypress, incense, olibanum, cistus, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Psychedelique Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," PsychÃ©dÃ©lique,  Jovoy's magnificent ambered patchouli,  largely stays in the shadows,  meditating on the synergies between a cocoa-like amber and an inky-dark patchouli,  although rose and geranium offer a touch of freshness to its earthy sexiness.The synaesthete might say that on the olfactory color wheel,  patchouli resides somewhere between black and chocolate brown,  with a bit of iridescent chartreuse green shimmering in between. Camphory,  inky,  aromatic,  and even darkly refreshing,  the elegant patchouli in PsychÃ©dÃ©lique is“dark,  smoky,  ambered,  generous and opulent, ” says FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin,  and in spite of its unfortunate branding given by unwashed hippies 1960s,  he says of this perfume that“Even the mud of Woodstock won't wash it away.”PsychÃ©dÃ©lique is like an olfactory Mark Rothko painting that explores the gradations between dark colors ”” in this case,  patchouli,  amber,  and musk. Darkly seductive and even comforting,  you might even call it 50 Shades of Black."," Citrus, rose, geranium, amber, patchouli, cistus labdanum, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Premier Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris," An amber perfume with an edge,  Ambre Premier gets a dark and glittering dose of patchouli added to what FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin calls“its almost childish first notes that evoke cotton candy, ” and maybe even a bit of chocolate. The rose in Ambre Premier peeks through in subtle counterpoint to its more gourmand personality,  adding a freshness and elegance that balances out its confectionary proclivities.  Spicy yet delicate,  candied yet elegant and grown-up,  Ambre Premier is an amber with many dimensions."," Candied orange, rose, patchouli, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flash Back Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," Straying ever-so-slightly from the brand's concept, the fragrance takes its name from film rather than photography. But then“flashback” makes sense at every level. The picture that inspired it, a dream-like screen capture of a video shot by Laurent Segretier, is the face of his long-distance girlfriend (a print of the image is included in the box). The perfumer who composed it, Olivier Cresp, had worked with the brand owner CÃ©line Verleure back in 1996 on L'Eau par Kenzo for women and for men, in her previous life as a top-flight project manager in the perfume industry. As for the scent, it is Olivier Cresp's own version of a flashback, a childhood memory he'd long wanted to use as a springboard for inspiration: rhubarb pie.But though the master perfumer pegs himself as“figurative”, don't expect a photorealistic impression of the homemade dessert. Flashback plays on the tart, green, citrusy aspects of rhubarb. Once unfolded, these facets connect with a bright, joyful vetiver whose grapefruit-like top notes are enhanced by actual grapefruit, before whispering the barest hint of flint and smoke.As luminous as a late spring afternoon in Cresp's native Grasse, as exhilarating as remembering a loved one's face. After all, isn't the charm of fragrance the way it materializes our memories?"," Rhubarb, grapefruit, orange, pink pepper, Granny Smith apple, vetiver, cedar, amber, musks.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lumiere Blanche Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," Picture a chalk cliff looming over a sea as still and metallic as mercury under a blazing sun... This is the picture selected by the renowned Italian photographer Massimo Vitali – whose work has been exhibited in major museums like the Guggenheim – as a brief for LumiÃ¨re Blanche (i.e.“white light”).To translate this concept of whiteness, but also the heat of the sun and the coolness of the sea, Sidonie Lancesseur has similarly played on olfactory contrasts. Coolness? A brace of cold spices like cardamom and star anise. Heat? The burn of cinnamon.  This spicy cocktail livens up a soothing, creamy blend of almond milk, sandalwood and tonka bean: the almond and sandalwood produce skin-loving milky effects, while the almond and tonka bean pick up on the licorice-y facets of the star anise. Powdery iris and musks add another, different layer of whiteness to a fragrance which, unusually, has a slightly milky aspect. A beautiful, sensuous yet candid fragrance that might just turn into your go-to bottle."," Cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, iris, almond milk, Cashmere wood, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Autoportrait Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," You'd think a photographer asked for a self-portrait would supply his likeness. Yet when CÃ©line Verleure, the owner of Olfactive Studio, reached out to Luc LapÃ´tre for a photographic fragrance brief, he offered a dream-like skyscape where a tiny, solitary figure walks under what looks like the sky reflected in a pool of water.To translate this meditative image into scent, the great Nathalie Lorson based her composition on age-old sacred resins: benzoin and incense. Autoportrait is a quiet, serene blend with a perfect balance of dry woodiness and soothing cuddliness (supplied by the milky vanilla facets of benzoin). Amazingly addictive yet deeply soulful, this seemingly simple scent keeps unfurling subtle facets, like ripples expanding on the surface of a lake."," Bergamot, elemi, Siam benzoin, incense, musks, oak moss, cedar, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chambre Noire Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," The dark room envisioned by ClÃ©mence RenÃ©-Bazin, an alumnus of the fabled Magnum agency, is in a hotel in Cairo with a view of the Nile, the modern city on the opposite bank rising in stark contrast with the antiquity of the legendary river...DorothÃ©e Piot's olfactive rendition of this image also draws on a contemporary vibe to express age-old ingredients. In fact, vintage fragrance lovers might well be delighted with this full-bodied blend: with its boozy, plummy notes, violet, patchouli and leather, Chambre Noire drops more than a hint of an old-school chypre. As though you'd smelled the sillage of Femme in a temple where incense had been burning.  After all, ancient Egyptians did consider that perfume was the sweat of the gods. All the more reason to treat yourself to this divine fragrance, as sensuous and mysterious as a hotel room in an exotic city – or as the innermost chamber of a temple dedicated to beauty."," Pink pepper, jasmine, papyrus (cypriol), violet, incense, prune, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, vanilla, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Still Life Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio," Despite its name, drawn like all the Olfactive Studio fragrances from the vocabulary of photography, this life is anything but still. It's more like the life of the party! Inspired by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Lebain's playful picture of mirror balls, party streamers and confetti (a print is included in the box), the young, up-and-coming perfumer Dora Arnaud has concocted a sparkling cocktail. Playing on the natural affinities of citrus and pepper – they share lemon-y facets --, she livens up the flavorful Japanese yuzu fruit with a blend of three peppers including the rare and precious Sichuan pepper, for a stunningly original cool-hot contrast. Dark rum turns up the heat in the base notes, anchored with dry, woody facets.This fiery, fizzy cocktail is just begging to be translated into a drink, but as a stunningly original new take on citrus, it's also a fabulous“energy drink” for your nose! Spritz on and dance the night away."," Yuzu, elemi, pink pepper, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, star anise, galbanum, dark rum, cedar, Ambrox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Labdanum 18 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," The most enigmatic and sensual and, unexpectedly, the most comforting in the Le Labo collection, Labdanum 18, composed by one of our favorite perfumers, Maurice Roucel, is a modern oriental masterpiece.  With its golden spiciness, its sweet musk and the animal undertones of civet and castoreum, Labdanum 18 makes a statement... but makes it in a quiet voice, drawing those around closer to the wearer, making them eager to smell more. The drydown, which is softer than soft, a delicate, whispery blend of the finest leather, vanilla and musk, offers the comfort that only the most loving embrace can provide.  Complex, always changing and dangerously addictive!Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Fleur D'Oranger 27 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Three years in production, Le Labo's ode to orange blossom might be the most sublimely unisex rendition that we know. Simultaneously true-to-life and elegantly stylized, Fleur d'Oranger 27, showcases its star note by enhancing both its citrusy and green side. The zesty aspect of orange blossom is underscored by the sunny, sparkly bergamot, petitgrain and grapefruit. The fragile beauty of snow-white blossoms is made even more dazzling when contrasted with the verdancy of vetiver and the dark richness of amber and musk. Breezy, intense and delightfully ambiguous, this is an orange blossom to be enjoyed by men and women alike.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Neroli 36 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Gracefully poised between a floral and a cologne, Le Labo's sunny creation is evocative of a morning walk on French Riviera...the blossoming trees, the sea breeze, the feeling of absolute well-being and contentment-- we don't know of a happier fragrance! After a fresh start, where neroli and mandarin orange sparkle with a slight hint of aldehydes and refresh us with a slight marine touch, jasmine starts to blossom, sweetened delicately by rose and vanilla. The base of musk and tonka bean lends the airy perfume warmth and sensuality.

Jasmin 17 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Jasmin 17, Maurice Roucel's unashamedly feminine creation for Le Labo, is guaranteed to make you feel pretty, oh so pretty! We know that the number in the title refers to the number of ingredients in the formula, but we suspect that it also has something to do with the fact this rendition of jasmine makes us feel like we are 17 again... no, it does not smell“too young”, it smells beautifully youthful! The radiant simplicity of the blend is what attracts us to Jasmin 17 the most. The pairing of vanilla and the airy jasmine, with its naturally honeyed undertone, is the proof that the most genius ideas are so very simple. The playful sensuality of the blend is enhanced by sandalwood and musk... and by Roucel's magical touch. Charmant!Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Vetiver 46 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," One whiff of the powerful masculinity of Vetiver 46, and all we can say is, hello Clark Gable. Who better to personify the old world elegance, strength, and sheer charisma of this fragrance? Celebrated nose Mark Buxton weaves top grade Haitian vetiver with pepper and cedar to give Vetiver 46 a dark, steely backbone, and then warms its edges with clove and gaiac wood. A hint of incense adds grace. Over the hours, the radiance of amber and vanilla shows Vetiver 46's more sensitive side. The result is an uncompromisingly male scent with the magnetism of a Hollywood star.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Bergamote 22 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Bergamote 22 started its life under the code name“Fire Cologne”, and as soon as we smelled the unexpected effervescent spiciness of its top notes, we knew why. Subtle but noticeable, the piquancy of nutmeg puts a twist on the classic citrus scent genre. The tingling spice compliments beautifully the fizzy notes of grapefruit and bergamot. The translucent green aspect brought on by petit grain is yet another layer that unfolds on the skin revealing the complex nature of this seemingly simple composition. The gauzy citrus notes are grounded by amber, musk and vetiver. The substantionality of the base notes gives Bergamote 22 weight and rich texture seldom found in citrus blends. A unisex fragrance with an unforgettable personality.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Oud Silk Mood - Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Kurkdjian imagined the OUD mood collection as feelings, sensations, rather like those one would have when wrapped in a fragrant stole. They play on shimmer, comfort and warmth. They are precious, intense and concentrated.OUD silk mood is a light, airy fragrance reminiscent of the rustle of silk or the soft touch of a rose petal. The fragrance is full of charm and mystery, sketched in Bulgarian rose, with blue chamomile from Morocco and papyrus. Sensitive and intriguing."," Bulgarian rose, Camomille from Marocco, Oud from Laos, Papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49832.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flower of Immortality Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," With Flower of Immortality, Kilian pays homage to the Chinese tale“A Tale of the Fountain of the Peach Blossom Spring”. It is recounted that a fisherman from Wu Ling loses his way along a stream and, unexpectedly, finds himself rowing alongside a lush peach tree forest. He decides to explore further and, at the end of the forest, lands at the fountainhead of the stream. There, he disembarks and just steps beyond, discovers a haven of peace, a utopian paradise where people live apart from the exterior world. For Kilian, Flower of Immortality is, above all, an olfactory homage to the peach blossom and its very strong symbolism in China. This blossom, whose pink petals are unveiled only in the middle of the winter, is believed to have the power to bewitch the human soul and to make it immortal. It is the set of symbols and myths that surround the flower that Kilian wanted to recreate in this new fragrance.Flower of Immortality was composed as the memory of the utopian paradise, where the fragrance of peach blossoms brings a promise of hospitality and immortality. The smooth and juicy scent of White Peach, interweaved by the sweet and powdery notes of Carrot and Iris. A dazzling breeze of Blackcurrant Bud absolute refreshes while the exquisite Rose Crystal is softened by the Tonka Bean and the scent of Vanilla beans drying in the sun."," White peach, blackcurrant bud, freesia, iris, rose crystal, vanilla, tonka bean, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42568.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud 27 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," The first new worldwide fragrance since Le Labo was created, Oud 27 uses its title note as a point of departure into the richly ornamented, dark and luscious world of oriental perfumes, weaving a story so multi-faceted and vivid that it might be an olfactory equivalent of one of Scheherazade's tales. The vibrant darkness falls with the very first accord, an extravagantly opulent mix of Atlas cedar and incense. The dry, resinous blend is brightened and softly sweetened by saffron, the golden spiciness of which glistens within the nocturnal fabric of Oud 27 like a constellation of far away stars. Gaiac and patchouli further deepen and enrich the balsamic top notes and lead the scent into an even more sensual territory. At once expansive and wild,  yet surprisingly intimate and soft, the scent is beautifully androgynous and would befit both Scheherazade and Shahryar. The creators call Oud 27, One Thousand and One Nights, bottled. We are so mesmerized by this oriental masterpiece that we would wear it for one thousand and one nights in a row and not miss another perfume.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Ambrette 9 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Ambrette 9, originally meant as a fragrance for babies and their mommies, is a reminder that there is a child in all of us. Centered on an ambrette seed note-- the delicate musky scent with a softly fruity undertone, it is the smell of baby's skin, of mother's caress, of human tenderness. Simple, radiant and comforting, ambrette, a perfume in itself, does not require much ornamentation to make it enthralling. Ambrette 9 accentuates the natural beauty of its star note with subtle floral and musky accents.

Iris 39 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Iris connoisseurs know that iris can be a diva: silky and elegant one moment and distanced and intellectual the next. With Iris 39, Le Labo did the seemingly impossible and crafted a warm, earthy iris. Iris 39's sexy blend of iris, patchouli, and oakmoss are shot through with the surprise of lime, ginger, and cardamom. If Iris 39 were a woman, she'd be renowned for her glamorous sense of style but loved for her open personality and sense of humor. She'd pack midnight picnics to eat under the stars, dance in nightclubs until dawn, and leave with her cell phone full of numbers, but she'd always be there for a friend in need.

Patchouli 24 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo," Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again. If you want straight patchouli, look elsewhere. If you are open to a fragrance that embraces the idea of patchouli, and yet is like nothing you've smelled before, welcome to Patchouli 24.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Aurore Nomade Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," Bertrand Duchaufour's third composition for The Different Company's Collection Excessive started out with what he dubs a“Sinbad accord”: star fruit on a tree in the sun, with apricot-y freesia accents and a touch of juicy, melon-y green...  Topped off with a flash of aged rum, this“Nomadic Dawn” could well be the name of a tropical cocktail sipped in a banana grove – the“banana flower” accord conjured with ylang-ylang – while plumerias waft in the distance...The burn of the rum and spices, bolstered with davana and immortelle, creates a sharp contrast with the thirst-quenching coolness of the fruity-aquatic notes. But this is no chichi, fancy-resort drink: picture Robert Mitchum handing it to Jane Russell in a sarong with a deep-pitched growl. Tough yet sophisticated tropicalia, and pretty much the next best thing to living it up on a Pacific Island."," Banana flower and star fruit accords, cinnamon, aquatic notes, nutmeg, rum, davana, fair-trade ylang-ylang from Madagascar, Egyptian geranium, clove, plumeria, indole, immortelle absolute, sandalwood, amber, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25326.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Fille de Berlin Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"“The Girl from Berlin” is Serge Lutens's third tribute to the rose, and his second to the divas of yesteryear after the Palais Royal exclusive Une Voix Noire, inspired by Billie Holliday... This time, the model remains unnamed, but she is obviously a creature of the decadent 1920s in Berlin: a sleek-legged, smoky-eyed femme fatale. Louise Brooks as the amoral Lulu in Pandora's Box,  a pre-Hollywood Marlene Dietrich crooning“Men cluster to me like moths around a flame” in The Blue Angel...  And how couldn't they? This angel is not blue, but as red as the petals of a blood-gorged rose. Here, the flower is expressed at its richest: you can almost taste its jamminess, lifted with metallic hints of pink and black pepper. But its velvety flesh is also a woman's, musky, honeyed and dark.A riveting, take-no-prisoners sillage monster, La Fille de Berlin is Lutens at the top of his flamboyant form. So femme a man could rock it. So true to the flower no rose lover should be without it.  So good it could even convert the rose-averse. Falling in love again, never wanted to... What I am to do? I can't help it."," Rose, violet, pink and black pepper, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36142.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Route d'Emeraude Eau de Parfum,Isabey," ""La Route d'Emeraude"" is inspired, with a touch of nostalgia, by the journey leading to the Emerald Triangle (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), filled with the scents of Jasmine Sambac and blooming flowers. Many Orient lovers took the path to these faraway lands and experimented sensations that are recaptured in this edition of the mythical perfume. Created in 1924, La Route d'Emeraude was designed by Julien Viard, in a faceted bottle and a jewel-like case, reminiscent of the splendor of the Far East.La Route d'Emeraude, is a sensational olfactive experience which holds a bewitching and opulent gem: Sambac Jasmine.Begin this experience and feel the sparkling freshness of bergamot spiced by cinnamon and softened by rose essence, unveiling a flamboyant floral bouquet. All the sensuality of Sambac jasmine intermingles with voluptuous Morocco jasmine absolute, orange flower and the richness of tuberose. Adorned with precious notes of amber, benzoin, vanilla and musk, this scented jewel leaves a unique and enveloping trail."," Bergamot, Rose Cinnamon, sambac Jasmine, Maroc Jasmine Absolute, Orange Flower, Tuberose, Amber, Benzoin, Vanilla, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Enchanted Forest Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Enchanted Forest is inspired by the endless sea of Russian forests and fairytales, as well as the most sensual ancient Slavic celebration named Kupala, rooted in the times of darkness, when all on the Earth knew its soul and its name (often too powerful to be uttered in vain or at all). French perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, the famous creator of fragrances for L'Artisan Parfumeur, Comme des GarÃ§ons and Penhaligon's, built Enchanted Forest around black currant, the smell and taste of which are so beloved in Russia and many other countries where it grows.”œThe challenge was great: I had to magnify the raw material (blackcurrant), a material used very often in perfumery and sometimes overused inelegantly through notes of red fruits, and in this regard I made a sort of soliflore. Soliflores are generally constructed on floral bases such as jasmine, rose, tuberose, but for Enchanted Forest the intention was quite different... and I had the idea of working the blackcurrant throughout the structure (head, heart, bottom) of the perfume. To do this, I used no less than a blackcurrant CO2 (an extract obtained directly from the blackcurrant buds, which is free of solvent residues), an absolute of blackcurrant and two different blackcurrant bases, including one of my own creation, to build a sort of skeleton, a vertical structure on which the entire perfume would be built.”œ – Bertrand Duchaufour"," pink pepper, aldehydes, sweet orange, flower cassis, blackcurrant leaf, hawthorn, effects of rum and wine, rosemary, davana, blackcurrant buds absolute, CO2 blackcurrant, Russian coriander seed, honeysuckle, rose, carnation, vetiverm, opoponax, Siam benzoin, amber, oakmoss, fir balsam absolute, patchouli, castoreum, cedar notes, vanilla, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nero Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," Intense and provocative. Nero is a take-no-prisoners woody oriental that mesmerizes and fascinates. It opens with citrus, but the moment of sunshine is fleeting as we enter a dark labyrinth of bittersweet saffron, bold cedar and hypnotic patchouli. The combination is dizzying – almost narcotic in nature – and we are led to an opulent lair filled with honeyed amber, burnished sandalwood and a deeply sensuous musk. Clearly, someone is up to no good. And if you are wearing this fragrance, it is probably you. As you would expect from Bruno Acampora, the musk note is incredible, and its warm, melting-into-the-skin quality keeps Nero smooth and balanced, and lets the darker elements frolic without running rampant over the entire composition. This means we can enjoy the risquÃ© decadence of cedar and saffron while still being perfectly welcome in polite society. In fact, we're fairly certain that if we were wearing this addictive blend, we would be welcome anywhere."," Citrus, saffron, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Prima T - Eau de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Luxurious and velvety soft, this rich floral glows like a ruby catching the firelight. Luminous flowers – white narcissus, jasmine and lily of the valley – stretch out on a pillowy bed of musk warmed with patchouli. This has the regal ease of chaise lounge and the warmth of a purring cat. Opulent and seductive, but done with such discretion that it feels like it's part of the wearer's skin. Deep, beautiful and elegant, like a solo on the viola. Suitable for royalty."," Narcissus, violet, jasmine, rose, Galbanum, mandarine, Lily of the valley(Muguet), Lily, Musk, Patchouly penang",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc - Eau de Parfum,Bruno Acampora," Every once in a while we encounter a fragrance that we instantly recognize as a forever-love and this is one of them. This is a truly superlative musk scent –  deep, spicy and drop dead sexy. This isn't  soft, sheer, clean musk – this is dramatic, untamed, sensuous musk that will get you noticed when you walk into the room and make the object of your desire weak in the knees. If it isn't the best musk ever, it's certainly in the running for that title, and there isn't a one of us here at Luckyscent who didn't stockpile this little number immediately.  An astonishing unisex scent which accomplishes that rare feat of being equally alluring on a man or a woman. Absolutely stunning."," Musk, Rose, Violet, Vanilla, Cloves, Amber, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Purple Eau de Parfum,Montale," Some older legends hold that it wasn't actually an apple that led Adam & Eve into temptation in that primordial garden, but a plum instead. We're no scholars, but a few moments with the seductive elegance of Dark Purple just might convince you. Gourmand floral notes and a dark, earthy base of musk and patchouli all work to frame a top note of plum so luscious and mouthwatering that you might be inclined to break a few rules too. Sophistication has never felt so indulgent."," Plum, fresh orange, rose petals, geranium bourbon, patchouli, red fruit cocktail, grey amber, teak wood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35446.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rosae Mundi Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Sometimes a rose fragrance can take a quiet and docile path, blushing and giggling with an innocent and soapy freshness. Classic and traditional - she's a safe bet and a loyal friend. Rosae Mundi is not that rose fragrance, and prefers not to show up to her boring parties. If she did decide to show, she'd kick down the door in a low cut dress and demand a man and a martini.Beginning with a tinge of berry sweetness that draws you in before it's too late, Rosae Mundi is a luscious and uncompromising beauty. She brings to the imagination a spontaneous trip to Venice and a night sloshed with wine and wilting roses. Rosae Mundi, or Rose of the World,  is a compilation of rose and earth - vetiver, patchouli, and cedar lend the rich and downy chaise upon which the divine rose curls. As the scent develops, these earthly pleasures divulge their secrets on the skin - complimenting one another beautifully. It seems as though this rose has been everywhere and seen everything, and yet still rises (though not too early, let's not push it) with a curiosity and eagerness to see what the new day holds."," Rose, patchouli, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Gracefully poised between a floral and a cologne, Le Labo's sunny creation is evocative of a morning walk on French Riviera...the blossoming trees, the sea breeze, the feeling of absolute well-being and contentment-- we don't know of a happier fragrance! After a fresh start, where neroli and mandarin orange sparkle with a slight hint of aldehydes and refresh us with a slight marine touch, jasmine starts to blossom, sweetened delicately by rose and vanilla. The base of musk and tonka bean lends the airy perfume warmth and sensuality. Joyful, elegant, infinitely charming, a warm-weather favorite!"," neroli, mandarin orange, rose, jasmine, calone, musk, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46845.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opardu Extrait de Parfum,Puredistance," Oh to be a madcap heiress, sliding through the crowd in a bias–cut satin gown and glittering pumps, a champagne cocktail in one hand and a leash leading to some exotic pet in the other. Your brows are perpetually arched as you scan the crowd for a dashing aviator or an adorably bookish professor to seduce. What scent are you wearing? Opardu, of course! Well, historically speaking, you wouldn't be  - but in the glorious art deco movie set of our minds, you are. Because Opardu is not about the past, it is about a fantasy of the past, just like our daydreams.  It evokes the enchantment and glamour of a bygone era, but still feels modern. The opening is especially evocative of another time and it is pure swank – like an expensive gift from a rich suitor, conjuring up images of mirror-topped vanities and red lipstick. This develops into an opulent floral featuring luminous gardenia, heady tuberose, piercing jasmine, and velvety rose. The mix is full and lush and there is the seductive thrum of cedar wood underneath it all. You might guess that the lilac and heliotrope would be overwhelmed by all of this and just sit off to the side and whisper to each other – but they are beautifully present, adding delicacy and charm as they put the twinkle in our saucy heroine's eye. As the scent wears on, the more ethereal elements continue to shine and the overall effect is absolutely lovely. Another beautiful scent created by Annie Buzantian for Puredistance."," Tuberose absolute, gardenia, Bulgarian rose, purple lilac, carnation, jasmine absolute, heliotrope, cedar wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect.Do you remember the old Marlboro ads? A man and his horse in front of the fire on a great plain under tall, blue evening skies - A defining image of the spirit of the American West with all it implied about masculinity and personal freedom. This man, firelight in his face, leaning on the worn leather saddle, alone with the desert wind, an icon so powerful that every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him... From this memory is born SANTAL 33: the ambition to create an olfactive form inspired by the great American myth still a source of fantasy for the rest of the world... A perfume that touches the sensual universality of this icon... that would intoxicate a man as much as a woman... that introduces our use of cardamom, iris, violet, ambrox which crackle in the formula and bring to this smoking wood alloy (Australian sandalwood, papyrus, cedarwood) some spicy, leathery, musky notes, and gives this perfume its unisex signature and addictive comfort. Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Australian sandalwood, cedarwood, cardamom, iris, violet, ambrox and leather accord Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Santal 33 Perfume Oil by Le Labo Ingredients Safflower oil base",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46830.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Bergamote 22 started its life under the code name“Fire Cologne”, and as soon as we smelled the unexpected effervescent spiciness of its top notes, we knew why. Subtle but noticeable, the piquancy of nutmeg puts a twist on the classic citrus scent genre. The tingling spice compliments beautifully the fizzy notes of grapefruit and bergamot. The translucent green aspect brought on by petit grain is yet another layer that unfolds on the skin revealing the complex nature of this seemingly simple composition. The gauzy citrus notes are grounded by amber, musk and vetiver. The substantionality of the base notes gives Bergamote 22 weight and rich texture seldom found in citrus blends.

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again. If you want straight patchouli, look elsewhere. If you are open to a fragrance that embraces the idea of patchouli, and yet is like nothing you've smelled before, welcome to Patchouli 24.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Patchouli, birch tar, styrax, and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46832.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. A rose for men destined to be stolen by women, Rose 31 takes the most feminine of all notes, darkens, dries and spicies it up turning it into a veritable emblem of masculinity. Mesmerizingly ambiguous, the fragrance alternates between the floral and the spicy with a generous dose of the woody and the animalic thrown in for good measure. The striking, elegantly austere beginning of Rose 31 gives way to the sweet, spicy star note of rose accompanied by fiery spices, pepper, clove and nutmeg. The naughty hint of cumin in the heart of the scent is a prologue to the sensual base of oud and vetiver. Dark, dangerous and sublimely refined, this is one of our favorite Rose perfumes of all time.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Grasse rose, cumin, pepper, clove, nutmeg, olibanum, cedar, amber, gaiac wood, oud, cistus, vetiver and animalic notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46833.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Jasmin 17, Maurice Roucel's unashamedly feminine creation for Le Labo, is guaranteed to make you feel pretty, oh so pretty! We know that the number in the title refers to the number of ingredients in the formula, but we suspect that it also has something to do with the fact this rendition of jasmine makes us feel like we are 17 again... no, it does not smell“too young”, it smells beautifully youthful! The radiant simplicity of the blend is what attracts us to Jasmin 17 the most. The pairing of vanilla and the airy jasmine, with its naturally honeyed undertone, is the proof that the most genius ideas are so very simple. The playful sensuality of the blend is enhanced by sandalwood and musk... and by Roucel's magical touch.

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. The first new worldwide fragrance since Le Labo was created, Oud 27 uses its title note as a point of departure into the richly ornamented, dark and luscious world of oriental perfumes, weaving a story so multi-faceted and vivid that it might be an olfactory equivalent of one of Scheherazade's tales. The vibrant darkness falls with the very first accord, an extravagantly opulent mix of Atlas cedar and incense. The dry, resinous blend is brightened and softly sweetened by saffron, the golden spiciness of which glistens within the nocturnal fabric of Oud 27 like a constellation of far away stars. Gaiac and patchouli further deepen and enrich the balsamic top notes and lead the scent into an even more sensual territory. At once expansive and wild,  yet surprisingly intimate and soft, the scent is beautifully androgynous and would befit both Scheherazade and Shahryar. The creators call Oud 27, One Thousand and One Nights, bottled. We are so mesmerized by this oriental masterpiece that we would wear it for one thousand and one nights in a row and not miss another perfume.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label."," Atlas cedar, incense, Patchouli, Saffron, Gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage – jasmine and tuberose absolute. They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room – creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat.

Tzora Eau de Parfum,Anat Fritz," Berlin-based designer Anat Fritz enlisted the help of master perfumer Geza Schoen to design the second fragrance in her collection. Tzora takes its name from the Israeli kibbutz Anat frequents in the summertime.  Known to be the biblical home of Samson and Delilah, Tzora boasts a landscape saturated with lemon, olive and pomegranate trees.  The scents of the earth, plants and sky combine to create a distinctive, multi-faceted fragrance.Tzora begins its journey with a slightly sweet blast of sun-ripened orange. The citric effervescence immediately ushers in a nose-tingling pinch of pepper. The mineral notes of warm earth and moss ground Tzora and in so doing, nudge the fragrance into the chypre style. The shadow of tall cypress trees offers an evergreen filter to the blend.  Subtle traces of vetiver carry Tzora into its rugged yet comforting dry-down.Tzora celebrates the union of man with earth. Equally at home in the boardroom, mountain hike or fine restaurant, Tzora bears the hallmarks of a modern classic in the making."," Cassis, clary, bergamot, Peruvian pepper, magnolia, osmanthus, jasmine, cedarwood, vetiver, patchouly, musk, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Akkad Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Akkad is a luminous amber perfume, mystical but also sensual, a descent into the profane pleasures of ancient tyrants, an exhalation of sacred oils and precious spices.Delphine Thierry, who composed this creation, imagined an amber note that is both spicy and luminous. The opposite therefore of the dark, mystical ambers that bring to mind the smoke of frankincense in ancient temples. Akkad amber opens with an aromatic citrus head note of mandarin and bergamot, enhanced by Clary sage. Clary sage, also known as“the sacred herb”, is renowned for its euphoric, harmonising properties. The heart unfolds in the rich, balmy, spicy notes of frankincense and styrax, evocative of the ancient east, cooled by elemi, a fresh, soothing herb, and intensified by cardamom. The base with its two ambers of plant and animal origin centres on the woody richness of patchouli, sweetened with a sensual vanilla."," Mandarin, bergamot, clary Sage, cardamom, elemi, frankincense, styrax, amber and cistus labdanum, vanilla and patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Galaad Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Galaad is a exotic leather fragrance, an invitation on a journey, the scent of an elegant rider who travels the world, a cosmopolitan spirit who loves the shade of tall trees and the freshness of mountain streams. A fragrance that is protective and assertive, yet utterly refined, emanating a peaceful self-assurance.A heart of myrrh is topped with spices that bring out refreshing head notes (cardamom), and sustained by aromatic base notes (rosemary, cypress). The base is cool leather with wood and tobacco (blond tobacco, Atlas cedar, agar oud). Delphine Thierry, who created Galaad, invites us to a tranquil morning ride in the mountains of the Middle East, when the scents of myrrh bushes blend with cypress resins and the woody fragrance of cedars. The leather of saddle and gloves gently warm up in the first rays of sun, while the little Arab horse snorts amidst the morning dew that has settled on Judean balsam trees and on the vines climbing along the mountain slopes of Galaad."," Cardamom, cypress, rosemary, myrrh, honey, copahu balm, Agar oud, Atlas cedar, cipriol, blond Burley tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31219.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Velours Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir," An opulent and boozy leather scent that is as velvety and luscious as a fresh peach. The leather note is smooth and supple, almost creamy, and is generously laced with rich tobacco, decadent rum and the dark, rough sweetness of the immortelle flower. At its best, as it is here, immortelle strikes us as the olfactory equivalent of a cat's purr – hints of ripe fruit and fresh hay wrapped in cozy, honeyed warmth.

Smooth with a woody-sweet finish, this fragrance mines the hidden depths of the night, beginning with its full-of-anticipation, heading-out-on-the-town opening (represented by lively, joyful citruses like bergamot and lime).

Musc Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"“The fragrance I imagined is a flowery, soft, extremely sensual caress. Musc intense is a union of rose and white musk. I like the liquer top note, the elegant essence of Turkish Rose. Carnation and violet take over from there, sustained by jasmine and rose absolutes. Musc Intense is an explosive cocktail of musk notes...A sensuous and particularly sophisticated fragrance. So Nicolai!” ”” Patricia NicolaiMusc Intense is a pillow-y floral musk, with a curious edge of clove and honeyed liqueur.  A sophisticated powder element keeps this musk clean and dressed up.

Do Son - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," Now reformulated in an Eau de Parfum, the creamy tuberose can be had in an extra concentrated form. Inspired directly from Yves Coueslant's childhood in Vietnam, where he grew up in HaÃ¯phong, a port in Northern Indo-China. Not far from there, in the little seaside resort of Do Son, his father had a pagoda built by the sea to go to and enjoy the sea air at the end of the day. Do Son recalls the memory of this place where flower fragrances dominate, in particular the tuberose, whose scent his mother particularly loves.

The Rose of May gives off its honeyed heat. The Indian Tuberose nakedly exhibits its milky roundness, while the narcotic sensuality of Egyptian Narcissus surges forth, uncontrollable and deliciously haunting. Notes of Virginia Cedar and Amber open up and try to assert their dominant character In order to contain that outpouring of opulence, but they never succeed in taming it completely.

During the initial stages of development it was essential that the fragrance represent actual vetiver, extracted from the root. With this in mind, not only is the finished concept  an authentic interpretation, it also reflects perfumer, Phillipe Romano's idea that imposing structures such as orientals, woods, spices with exotic shades should transport you far away."," Yuzu, Bitter Orange, Bergamot, Nutmeg, Resinous Elemi, Wormwood, Benzoin, Damp Oakmoss, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amyris Pour Femme Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Francis Kurkdjian conceives his fragrances with people in mind, and what he wanted for Amyris femme was to express the quintessence of the Parisian woman, which he defines as primesautiÃ¨re, a word that means“perky” and“impulsive”. He also conceives his collection as a fragrance wardrobe for every moment of the day and with the Amyris his'n'hers duo, he wanted scents that could be shrugged on for daywear: chic, but comfortable enough not to demand major commitment before spritzing.Amyris is a wood formerly known as West Indies sandalwood, which draws its name from the Greek amyron,“intensely fragrant”: it was in rediscovering its scent during exercises with his apprentice that Francis Kurkdjian was inspired to use it.

He also conceives his collection as a fragrance wardrobe for every moment of the day and with the Amyris his'n'hers duo, he wanted scents that could be shrugged on for daywear: chic, but comfortable enough not to demand major commitment before spritzing.Amyris is a wood formerly known as West Indies sandalwood, which draws its name from the Greek amyron,“intensely fragrant”: it was in rediscovering its scent during exercises with his apprentice that Francis Kurkdjian was inspired to use it.

Santal Majuscule Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Now that Santal Blanc has been shifted to the exclusive Palais-Royal collection, Serge Lutens's export line was bereft of a scent showcasing one of the major materials of his oriental palette. Santal Majuscule, which means“sandalwood with a capital letter”, plays on the secular harmony of this creamy, smoky, almost floral note with roses. The unexpected twist is the addition of cocoa – not the dry, powdery type matched with patchouli in Borneo 1834, but a smooth touch of chocolate that marries with the milkiness of sandalwood in a subtly gourmand accent. A tender, subtle rendition of the note: in“majuscule”, you could read“magic” – as in the magical world of a little black-eyed boy called Serge, who put capital letters to words like“Gold”,“Fire” and“Flowers”."," Sandalwood, rose, cocoa, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36141.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Citrico,Comme des Garcons: Cologne," A dry and masculine citrus, Citrico never crosses the line into the lime-based aftershaves of yesteryear.  A non-sweet bitter orange and aged bergamot are Citrico's heart; rosemary makes itself known as the herb base that this cologne lays upon, while cedar and sandalwood, while barely detectable, tame the mighty citrus.  It's not a bright, sunny citrus scent; think more of a smooth, dry fragrance...perfect in any weather and anytime of day."," bitter orange, bergamot, neroli, cedar, sandalwood, lemon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anbar,Comme des Garcons: Cologne," Anbar takes its name from the original Arabic name for amber.  Amber, prized for its warm, sweet incensey scent, is more of a background scent in the beginning, as the citrus asserts itself. Anbar gradually kicks up the warm, sensual quotient as it evolves...the longer you wear it, the more the amber melds with your body heat.  Alluring and more than a little romantic."," amber, mandarin, carnation, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Ombre Dans L'Eau - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque," The amazingly evocative scent of an English rose garden redolent with black currant has now been re-formulated in an effort to accentuate the major notes.  In this enhanced iteration we find a bit more of the crisp green notes of the cut rose stems at the top which lazily recede to reveal the supple rose and currant.   You can still smell the wet earth of the riverbank and the berries weighing down the branches and the older petals which have fallen, but there's now a heightened sense of the signature notes. The melancholy has been amplified to create a new take on a cherished classic."," Black currant leaves, rose, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

X for Women Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian," According to lore, Cleopatra so adored Egyptian jasmine, gathered from the banks of the Nile at dusk when the flower's scent is at its headiest, that she doused the sails of her ship with their essence on her journey to meet Mark Antony.

Egyptian jasmine is refreshed and made momentarily sharp by fruit notes such as tart rhubarb and juicy peach and pineapple. Vanilla and labdanum soften and enrich those notes, and the perfume is made even more erotic with the X series' signature note of Karo Karundi, a white flower essence from the West African shrub whose scent recalls the Acacia flower and is reputed to be an aphrodisiac.The notes in X for Women blend beautifully not only with each other, but also with skin, creating a warm, sweet and luscious skin scent that, like X for men, could be described as approachably erotic.

The best Indian jasmine, Tahitian vanilla, Rose Centifolia, carnation and ylang-ylang, make up No. 1's heart, helping to explain the perfume's designation as the world's most expensive, made without reference to cost. But this cost helps produce an intoxicating scent experience that is recognizably special at first spray.No. 1 starts with a floral high that sustains itself operatically, with subtle pineapple, plum and lemon revolving around intense jasmine and ylang-ylang notes. It then evolves into an ambery vanilla base touched with cedar, musk and the smoothest sandalwood. By the time the perfume dries down, the marriage of these precious ingredients is seamless, and the floral drama subsides into a comforting, ambery-vanillic warmth that lasts. The Empress does have clothes."," Pineapple, plum, mirabelle, bergamot, lemon, and cardamom, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, orris, orchid, vanilla, tonka seeds, cedarwood, sandalwood, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Like most of Clive Christian's scents designated for men, this elixir is easily categorized as unisex."," Bergamot, lime, Sicilian mandarin, cardamom, nutmeg, thyme, lily of the valley, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, ambery woods, and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Oud - Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," It isn't because Francis Kurkdjian called this fragrance just plain Oud that he meant it to be a plain-vanilla oud. The man couldn't be pedestrian if he tried. And what he's gone and done is work what he calls“the ambergris of the 21st century” into a quintessentially elegant French perfume, taming the growling exotic beast until it purrs with pure bliss on a silk cushion. This is an oud even the most ouded-out could curl up with. Sweetly leathery and animalic, with the touch of honey real oud gives off – and there is real Laotian oud in the blend. With its citrus and pepper facets, elemi resin adds sparkle to the top notes. Saffron brings out the leather effects of oud, set into the tenderest woods: the leathery, almost jam-sweet Atlas cedar, and a lavish, un-musty patchouli. Francis Kurkdjian says he composed his Oud while dreaming of a marble and gold palace in the desert sands fit for“the prince of raw materials”. He's done more than that: he's turned oud into a flawlessly elegant classic of the perfumer's palette."," Elemi resin, saffron, Atlas cedar wood, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49822.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

S-ex Eau de Parfum,S-Perfume," S-ex (pronounced“es-ex”) isn't another avant-garde perfume that claims, in flowery prose, to be the perfume representation of sweaty sheets. S-ex is hardcore sultry and fresh at the same time-- a sheer and sensual daredevil of a scent that toys with opposites. It's a wet, sensual skin musk meets just washed, clean skin; all through it is a animalistic leather (with a metallic tinge) toying with fresh and crisp notes like bergamot. S-ex is a well balanced study of opposites attract; and we like that despite the name, it's not some one-trick-pony weighed down solely by heavy hitters. Instead, it arouses your senses with both depth and sheerness; it's steely and gentle, quiet and smoldering, and it does it all without falling in the women's-only or men's-only scent camp. If you love sensual, headboard-grabbing fragrances but have longed for a perfume that's wearable anywhere and any time of day, then a little S-ex is just what you need.

It's a whirlwind of a perfume twisting and turning with a passionate swirl of black cacao, deep, red fruits and florals. Soft rose notes are a velvety embrace, a masterful turn that allows the dusty cocoa-like notes in 100% Love to shine just right... but not enough to be exactly like a box of chocolates.

Fils de Dieu Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The tagline for this Fils de Dieu, du Riz et des Agrumes (”œSon of God, rice and citrus” is“He brings the sunshine”). But despite these distinctly religious references, there is nary a tear of incense in Ralf Schwieger's dÃ©but scent for Ã‰tat Libre d'Orange. And despite a list of notes that almost reads like the recipe for a South-eastern Asian dish, Fils de Dieu never veers into the foody: rather, it shows how the aromas lacing one of the most refined cuisines in the world are also perfumes. The green, citrusy top notes add sparkle to the cardamom and ginger, churning up the milky, powdery accents of the rice and coconut notes. The latter is picked up by the lactonic facets in jasmine, while a rich May rose hints that the Queen of flowers and steamed rice may have secret affinities.Then as it moves into the drydown, Fils de Dieu reveals its animal nature by exhaling a soft, dark leather note, more suede than rawhide, infused with musk. And we sing Hallelujah."," Ginger, coriander leaves, lime, shiso, bergamot, Jungle Essence coconut, rice note, Jungle Essence cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, French May rose, tonka bean, vetiver, musk, amber, leather, castoreum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47741.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bijou Romantique Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The name comes from a line said by Hugo Pratt's cult graphic novel hero, the half-gypsy sailor Corto Maltese, in The Ballad of the Salt Sea:“Adieu, bijou romantique” (”œFarewell, romantic jewel). The tagline,“Her price is far above rubies”, is drawn from the Scriptures.As for the scent, it is by Mathilde Bijaoui, whose dark beauty would have surely inspired Hugo Pratt had he known her. It was Mathilde who signed the critically acclaimed Tilda Swinton Like This, and with Bijou Romantique she offers another delicately hued composition that hovers just on the edge of being the most ethereal gourmand, with the subtle chocolate facets of iris, vetiver blending into the creaminess of vanilla and benzoin. Laboratoire Mane's captive molecule EVEE bridges the gap between vanilla and spices, lightly brushing the blend with the burn of clove.Tender, complex and multi-facetted, Bijou Romantique lives up to its name. Who knew the bad boys at Ã‰tat Libre d'Orange had it in them to be so chivalrous?"," Bergamot, Italian lemon, pink pepper essence, ylang-ylang, clary sage, Tuscan iris, Jungle Essence coconut, Haitian vetiver, patchouli, benzoin, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47742.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Precious Oud Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," In 2009, Van Cleef & Arpels Haute Parfumerie stepped out with a range sublimating emblematic essences. That is how Collection Extraordinaire, a range of monofloral compositions and a cologne, came about. Today, a new chapter has been added to this wonderful story. Following on from the great classics, the timeless foundations of the collection, a“free form” piece glorifying Oud essence has been created.The new opus, Precious Oud, pays homage to a mythical essence. The aquilaria, an Asian or Indian tree, actually only reveals its powerful scent via the infection of the wood by a fungus. A magi-like essence alongside frankincense and myrrh, the fragrant Oud resin, woody and balsamic, adds earthy and leathery accents. The perfumer Amandine Marie has chosen to interpret Oud essence and associate it with flowers. The top note is bright and sparkling bergamot set off with pink peppercorn whilst already hinting at the tonality of the perfume with the scent of opulent incense. The heart note is a vibrant bouquet of the most beautiful flowers - sensual jasmine accompanied by tuberose. If not the queen of perfumery, then the tuberose could very well be the empress with its bewitching, divinely heady scent. There is a woody note of patchouli, and the base notes open up, opulent, rich and precious, surrounding the mythical Oud with the woody notes of sandalwood and vetiver and enveloping it in accents of amber.With its warm and sensual sillage, Precious Oud embodies the new opus of Collection Extraordinaire. A perfume with character, it has paved the way for new inspiration, totally free art where only the most noble, precious materials are given pride of place and the guiding principle is excellence."," bergamot, pink pepper, incense, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, oud, sandalwood, vetiver and ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums," Dark is heavily oxidized rose mixed with violets and leather. It's a take on the classic rose note, a bloody, flowery, leathery, seductive perfume with a purpose. The heavy metallic note in the scent brings an unexpected urprise while its animalistic and powdery side suggests certain comfort - both reassuring and protective. Dark is a scent with a mind of its own, and it can take you to places you never dreamed of going.New for Winter 2018: Andrea Maack has doubled down on this cult classic rose scent, keeping the beloved original formula intact while upgrading the quality and rarity of each ingredient. Now, the rose note is fresher, juicier, and lusher, keeping the sparkling metallic accord and gently animalic leather in a cleaner balance and seriously upping the seductive factor. It's the same Dark you've always loved- now even better."," Yellow mandarin, pink berries, petitgrain, lemon tree, aldehydes, rose, metal, green apple ambergris, orange blossom, virginia cedarwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
What We Do In Paris Is Secret Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," You know how the notes in some perfumes read like something from your wildest, fragrant dreams but end up smelling like a Franken-fume, something you should love but don't, something that's less than the sum of its parts? What We Do In Paris Is Secret actually exceeds the gorgeous sounding symphony of its notes (and that's a hard thing to do!). It's impossible not to be lured in by the rich, sweet notes of vanilla, honey, tonka bean and tolu, the warm sensuality of sandalwood, musks, ambergris, and the playful Turkish rose, lychee and bergamot. Addictive doesn't quite explain it-- we couldn't keep this away from our skin when we first sampled (honestly) and oh, by the way? It makes heads turn. Not in that“You're leaving a vapor trail!” way, but in that,“Please tell me what you're wearing now!” way. Creamy, decadent, honeyed and sensual. If those are the kind of words that make your heart race when you think of a perfume, then look no further."," Bergamot, honey, lychee, Turkish rose essence, tonka bean, vanilla, heliotrope, tolu, sandalwood, ambergris, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sombre Negra Eau de Parfum,YOSH," Sombre Negra, or black shadow, is the debut scent in the new“M” Series by San Francisco perfumer, Yosh Han. Highly sought after for her exclusive custom fragrances, Han says,“The“M” series is a departure from the ethereal quality of my previous collections and explores fragrances that evoke our deepest nature.”Sombre Negra is a double agent. Intelligent, beguiling, captivating. The man who wears Sombre Negra is not what he seems. He is elegant and forbidden. His presence is undeniable but he can vanish without a trace. The woman who wears Sombre Negra is a smoldering beauty. Highly perceptive and discerning, she knows more than she lets on. She sees beyond the shadows, without fear of the unknown.Please note, this is a newly re-imagined Sombre Negra.Perfumer Notes: ”I launched a Limited Edition Sombre Negra exclusively with LuckyScent in 2010. That fragrance to me was dark and edgy. Very dense. I wanted to explore the idea of shadows and their mutations so I decided to create a new edition of Sombre Negra. The new M:001 Sombre Negra incorporates citrus top notes that reflect a flash of lightning - a spark of fire that quickly vanishes but casts new and elongated shadows. Rose, tonka and orris were added to give it some depth and fullness. Nutmeg and cumin give the fragrance a kind of vegetative musk and suede element to an otherwise smokey and leathery fragrance. It is still very masculine but Sombre Negra is also the 'boyfriend fragrance' that women are falling in love with and keeping for themselves."," Vetiver, patchouli, cedar, olibanum, pink pepperberry and black peppercorn, clove, juniper, citrus, nutmeg, cumin, tonka and orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22823.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Geisha Rouge - Eau de Parfum,Aroma M," In response to numerous clamorous requests, Aroma-M announces the eau de parfum version of her best selling Geisha Rouge perfume oil.The difference? While this formulation Geisha Rouge is warm, beckoning, enticing. Its blend of tonka bean, tobacco and vanilla, combined with cinnamon, star of anise, clove, and sandalwood traditional Japanese incense ingredients are still in their original proportions, the added presence of alcohol serves to lighten it up and give it some breathing space. In its newly diffused form, the fragrance is more noticeable to those in your direct vicinity giving it a mellow yet racy, smoky, appeal, not unlike that of a gentle, irresistible red flame. Here is one beautiful, unisex fragrance that is not based on flowers, but on seductive spices and woods that convey the meaning of vivacious sensuality held in check but barely so."," Tonka bean, tobacco, vanilla, sandalwood, cinnamon, star of anise, clove",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11133.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pluie de Soleil Eau de Toilette,Phaedon," Loosely translated, you could say Pluie de Soleil means“It's raining sunshine”. At any rate, that's what this exhilarating fragrance feels like, each drop carrying a succulent burst of summer. With its fresh fruity facets, freesia melds seamlessly with strawberry and pineapple, while adding a touch of frilly femininity. This is fruity floral done right, with just enough sandalwood to keep it from toppling into Tropicana. Fun, unpretentious, and as colorful as a summer market."," Bergamot, lemon, freesia, strawberry, pineapple, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Rose Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Eau Rose, a fresh-floral perfume that pays tribute to the queen of flowers, the rose. Forever immortalized by Ronsard's famous poem“Mignonne, allons voir si la rose...”, it was only a matter of time before diptyque decided to showcase the rose. To get off the beaten track and create something different, the Eau Rose has been conceived to stand out as a genuine infusion of roses. Its olfactory composition is designed to celebrate the multiple aromas of the flower in its natural state, as it blossoms over time. It's like taking an olfactory stroll, which you savor from morning to night, by wearing a rose that changes as the hours go by and melts into the scent of the person wearing it."," Bergamot, black currant, Centofilia and Damask rose, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48385.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dolce Acqua Eau de Parfum,Profumum," If you know the Profumum line, you may have noticed that they often involve a bit of a journey. We generally start with where they begin, but this time we'll start with where Dolce Acqua ends: a room where cookies have been baking all day. Vanilla, almond and coconut in a doughy blend with a flourish of powdered sugar and that hint of cherry that we associate with heliotrope. There is also a little something cool in the mix that we can't quite put our fingers on – balsam-like and airy. There is a nostalgic quality – a hint of beloved childhood confections that melt on the tongue. Testing it on three generations, they each recalled a different beloved treat – so we can't say it resembles a particular delicacy as much as it evokes the memories of someone baking your favorite thing for you. So, if you end up with a dreamy vanilla almond fluffery that coddles and soothes, where do you begin? With a boisterous and boozy caramel-like vanilla with a pronounced swirl of almond, which then takes a fascinating detour into something mysteriously reminiscent of beeswax, before it arrives at its soft and comforting destination."," Coconut, heliotrope, almond, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eccelso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," You don't always need to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes you just need to make an excellent wheel that gets you where you want to go in style. Eccelso is a divinely elegant scent for gentlemen, with a classic feel. Do not mistake classic for dull, however - the components are exquisite, the craftsmanship is impeccable and the result is not only magnificent, but incredibly appealing.  The vibrant opening of sparkling bergamot spiked with nutmeg perfectly paves the way for a creamy, lemon-tinged magnolia. A luxurious base of sensuous musk, Mysore sandalwood, patchouli and labdanum adds layers of warmth and depth. The result is complex and nuanced, with glimmers of smoke and spice playing off the citrus aspect that has been enriched and rounded by the magnolia. This is rich and reassuring, but it also has an easy charm that oozes confidence and a dash of mystery. This is the rakish younger son who surprises everyone when he is called upon to rule and rises to the occasion to become a beloved monarch. Truly exceptional."," Bergamot, nutmeg, magnolia, Mysore sandalwood, musk, patchouli, labdanum resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
07 Tanoke Eau de Parfum,Odin," Developed by perfumer Corinne Cachen, 07 Tanoke conjures the natural aromas of Californian landscapes near seaside terrains, amounting to a pure and recognizably American scent. Archived in the roots of the soaring redwood, 07 Tanoke brings forth the balsamic resin of wet gaiacwood wrapped in smoky incense. Crisp black pepper, bitter orange and spicy ginger hover over the surface for an airy, brightness that defines the masculine and feminine dichotomy that characterizes Odin New York's growing palette of fragrances.Amid the wilderness of coastal hinterland comes a woody blend grounded in soaring redwoods and warm musk.

Bluff,Lubin," At first a refreshing invigorating blend of citrus fruits, wood extracts and spices Bluff will then reveal itself as an extremely elegant yet sensual unisex eau de parfum. Inspired by the invigorating if not entirely effective remedies supplied to the pioneers in the Wild West during the 19th century gold rush. Once developed by emigrant physicians, these tonics were first considered medicine but they would soon become a part of American culture which would ultimately be further transformed into the soft drink culture at the turn of the 20th century.A distinguished fragrance with deceiving first impressions: crowned with lime, bergamot and an accord of nutmeg and cinnamon, Bluff opens fresh and spicy. It then reveals sensual, with mouthwatering heart notes of clary sage, iris and kola nut. This blend rests on an exquisite foundation of Vetiver cedar, patchouli and sandalwood vanilla."," Lime, bergamot, nutmeg, cinnamon, clary sage, iris, kola nut, vetiver cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Figaro Eau de Toilette,Lubin," The barber of Seville. Bold and seductive like the figaro from Beaumarchais' plays, Figaro in takes liberties with conventions much like the character who inspired it. An extremely original unisex fragrance, its construction is based on the daring opposition of vetiver and fig, which starts out green and ends up with gentle amber and woody base notes."," Grapefruit,  bergamot,  pink peppercorns,  marine pine, fig and apple,  damson,  coriander leaves,  clover,  essence of vetiver,  styrax,  sandalwood,  tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31215.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Itasca Eau de Parfum,Lubin," The scent of North American forest. The Mississippi river finds its main source in the legendary Lake Itasca in the heart of Minnesota. Itasca is reminiscent of the forests covering the American landscape once inhabited by the Algonquin tribes and pioneers exploring the depths of the new continent.Core notes of Minnesotan red pine mingle with a base of amber, incense, vetiver Java and Texas cedar woods. After fresh top notes of juniper berries, a spicy harmony then unfolds where dominant woody notes are accented with clove and nutmeg.A spiced vetiver, Itasca opens with citrus fruits refreshed by juniper berries, followed by a harmonious combination of oriental woods, vetiver, and red Minnesotan pine. This scent evokes the forests that surround Lake Itasca, the source of the great Mississippi river, and a legendary place guarded by Algonquin Indians.UPDATE: We're thrilled to welcome back this long beloved spicy-fresh classic, now in a stronger Eau de Parfum concentration. While the subtle, airy woods and vetiver of the EDT are very much the same as they've always been, the new concentration means the freshness lingers for hours longer- albeit seductively close to the skin."," Neroli,   Marigold,   Mandarin,   Juniper Berry and Grapefruit,  Clove,   Tonka Bean,   Clary Sage,   Nutmeg,   Geranium Flower,  Itasca Red Pine (pinus resinosa),   Java Vetiver and Texan Cedar,   Partak Incense,   Ethiopian Myrrh,   Amber and Canadian Fir Balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31216.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Kinski Eau de Toilette,Kinski," KINSKI the fragrance is a richly decadent, textured scent produced under license from Kinski Productions, to mark the 20th anniversary of the legendary actor's death.  Effervescent notes of cassis and juniper provide an uplifting contrast to the dark notes of madness evidenced in castoreum, smoky vetiver and dark woods. The image of Kinski portraying Count Dracula in Werner Herzog's expressionistic cinematic masterpiece Nosferatu The Vampyre emerges, as the heady notes of blood-red wine rises from the dusty, dirt floors of an unlit cellar. Dry herbs crackle softly as they crumble in hand. Salty oceanic notes reveal themselves in the heart, inspired by Kinski's love of the sea. The animalic and woody base of the composition reflects Kinski's almost feral sensuality.The simple and bold graphic design of the bottle hints at an essence of fragmentation, echoing the actor's famously splintered personality.  Utterly unique and complex, KINSKI ignites an obscure passion in the wearer."," Cassis, juniper berry, schinus molle (Peruvian pepper), castoreum, marijuana acccord, nutmeg, plum, orchid, magnolia, orange flower, rose, benzoin, vetiver, cedar, patchouly, styrax, cistus, costus (ginger), musk, moss, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Azemour les Orangers Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Parfum d'Empire fragrances are always highly concentrated both in rich natural essences and intense emotion. But even so, Azemour stands apart. Just as Eau de Gloire was a tribute to Corsica, the homeland of Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's family, Azemour is a loving reminiscence of Morocco where he was born and grew up. The name is taken from the ancient city of Azemmour on the Atlantic coast, near the orange groves his parents once owned. As for the scent, it is an olfactory landscape that captures the exhilarating fragrances of the orange tree, from the fruit and leaves to the flowers and bark, generously sprinkled with a blend of spices. A glorious quality of hay absolute, oak moss and henna absolute – a typically Moroccan scent reminiscent of Argentinean matÃ© – conjure the dry vegetation of the groves and dunes.  A tiny, briny accent (no, it isn't an aquatic note) adds a touch of sea spray. Wood notes trace the undulating silhouettes of cypresses in the Atlantic wind.And best of all, for those of us who love classic fragrance families, Azemour is a robust, vibrant, hesperidic chypre, so full-fleshed you'll feel you could bite it."," orange, clementine, tangerine, grapefruit, coriander, cumin, black pepper, pink pepper, blackcurrant, galbanum, neroli, geranium, orange blossom, rose, hay, moss, henna and cypres",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Ambre de Carthage Eau de Parfum,Isabey," In the 1920s the House of Isabey stood at 20 rue de la Paix and was the destination of the most chic parisians.  Its perfumes evoked exotic travels and fantasies inspired by flowers, spices and other fragrant materials.  L'Ambre de Carthage of 1924 was hailed as one of the jewels of the perfumed crown. Today Isabey revives the name of L'Ambre de Carthage in a modern masculine fragrance symbolizing the spirit of long, challenging journeys and adventures.The scent is for those whose life is a journey. Ancient Carthage held a position as one of the capitals of maritime trade; its ports teaming with trade ships transporting the precious cargo of far off lands. L'Ambre de Carthage begins with the crisp notes of Mediterranean citrus and settles into the warm ambery scent of cistus labdunum.  The journey proceeds to China where delicate osmanthus flowers and aromatic jasmine tea offers a soft counterpart to the darker notes of olibanum incense. The adventure ends in India, traveling through unknown towns and landscapes finding delight in the earthy scent of patchouli and precious sandalwood.The journey is never really known or complete. Far into the desert, a sandstorm rises and sweeps everything on its passage."," Cistus, Bergamot , Osmanthus, Jasmine Tea, Patchouli, Amber, Sandalwood, Olibanum, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Idole de Lubin - Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Olivia Giacobetti has created a new, adventurous fragrance for heroines who fear no danger and boldly explore hostile, foreign lands in search of unexplored horizons. Alexandra David-Neel, Mary Kingsley, Amelia Earhart, Charmian Kitteredge and Karen Blixen: these daredevil women, who never let fear get in the way of their curiosity, are guided only by their taste for excitement and exploit, their desire to explore the unknown.Idole de Lubin Eau de Parfum is a loving tribute to these women's steadfast character, as well as their bold femininity and the apparent paradoxes of their personality. It exalts their smile which radiates from sepia-toned photographs and brightens their countenance in the face of danger, as well as the boldness and valour that they exhibit while braving the elements.Idole de Lubin Eau de Parfum, offers a unique twist to the already successful and admired Eau de Toilette version. Amber, rock rose and frankincense have joined the ebony, spices, rum and leather of the original Eau de Toilette to soften its middle notes and add depth to Idole de Lubin's trail, a true elixir of adventure."," Rum absolute, saffron, black cumin, bitter orange peel, Doum palm, rock rose, smoked ebony, frankincense, sugar cane, leather, red sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31208.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Oud,Creed," Wood, leather, marble, and gold. These luxurious elements of a Persian palace are the inspiration behind the architecture of Royal Oud. Precious, sweet oud is carefully extracted from agarwood trees, a carefully-guarded resource that grows only in certain parts of India. Oud's rarity lends to the expense of the fragrance's coveted raw materials, prized by both the men and women who wear it. A fashionable favorite amongst today's royals and heads of state, Royal Oud's universal blend bottles the splendor of palace life across continents."," Lemon, pinkberries, bergamot, cedar, galbanum, angelica roots, sandalwood, oud, Tonkin musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49328.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Indochine Eau de Toilette,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The ever-prolific, ever-inventive Pierre Guillaume takes the oriental genre as far as it can go – in fact, all the way to the Far-East – with Indochine, a scent inspired by the dream of a languid cruise down the Mekong in the 1920s.Over the course of his imaginary journey, Guillaume has gathered ingredients rarely used in perfumery as a sensuous setting for benzoin's vanillic, powdery and spicy facets. Its creaminess is brought out by the smoky, milky undertones of tanakha, a traditional cosmetic whose smell is reminiscent of sandalwood. Subtle Kampot pepper from Cambodia, considered to be the best in the world, and green, sparkling Ceylonese cardamom, underline the spiciness, while Laotian honey wraps the accords in the quirky-gourmand notes that are the trademark of so many Parfumerie GÃ©nÃ©rale fragrances.The result is a fascinating, intensely sensuous fragrance that feels as though it could be burned in a temple, blended into an edible delicacy or used in an aphrodisiac ritual. We leave it entirely up to you."," Siam benzoin resinoid, Kampot pepper, Ceylonese cardamom, Burmese tanakha, Laotian honey.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34545.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pour un Homme Eau de Toilette,Caron," In the early 1930s, men's use of fragrance was not considered virile. However, one would occasionally dab on a touch of lavender water. Created in 1934, Pour Un Homme was the first Caron fragrance created exclusively for men. The lavender heart blended with vanilla, musk, and amber makes this fragrance truly unique. The yin and the yang of deep and refreshing scents highlight a mysterious duality and sophistication.  Pour Un Homme comes encased in a no-frills, masculine bottle."," Lavender, vanilla, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55313.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Juniper Sling Eau de Toilette,Penhaligons," Introducing Juniper Sling, an intoxicating new fragrance inspired by the most iconic and atmospheric of spirits: London Dry Gin. Created for Penhaligon's by Master Perfumer Olivier Cresp, Juniper Sling is a playful, chilled and mysterious homage to the Bright Young Things of London's roaring twenties. For enigmatic boys and girls, Juniper Sling is a crisp cocktail shot of gin with the freshness of juniper, cool measures of angelica and brandy and a beating libertine heart of black pepper, cardamom, soft leather and orris. A gourmand base of brown sugar, black cherry and amber add sensuality to the scent. A beloved and iconic tipple has been transformed into a complex and compulsive skin scent.

L'eau Chic Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," The name says it all. Patricia de NicolaÃ¯ keeps turning out some of the most classically elegant fragrances on the market, and her addition to her“eau” line is as effortlessly chic as a crisp cotton shirt on a summer morning.The perfumer was inspired by the geranium-scented soaps she used to love as a child in her parents' bathroom. The challenge, she said, was softening the sharp, tangy facets of geranium oil, and making it original without covering it up.Spearmint and peppermint boost geranium's own cool minty facets; lavender adds its clean, aromatic freshness while in contrast, a duet of hot spices – clove and pimiento – team up with milky sandalwood and the to ground L'Eau Chic in warmth.  Roman chamomile, with its herbal, green, boozy, spicy and woody facets, adds sophistication and complexity to the blend. But just like that indefinable set of qualities that make up chic, L'Eau Chic is more than the sum of its parts: it is bursting with well-bred confidence, with the classic vibe of a scent that could have been used for several generations by a family of slightly eccentric aristocrats, yet bracingly modern. In a word: not only chic, but pretty cool too..."," Bourbon geranium, peppermint, spearmint, lavender, sandalwood, Roman chamomile, iris, clove, pimiento, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31336.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cinnamon Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Sherbet," Refreshing cinnamon sherbet? CdG once again twists the norm, taking a spice most associated with baked goods and hot, wintry drinks and making it bracing and fresh. The cinnamon here is more of an afterthought, appearing only as a brief whisper on the edges of this lightly herbed scent.  The white musk gives this a clean, sheer feel, and the orangey bergamot gives it zest.  Like a cool breeze on a sweltering day, Cinnamon will surprise you with its uplifting nature."," cedar, bergamot, cinnamon, saffron, carnation, benjamin (aka benzoin, a resinous balsam), vetiver, teak wood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rhubarb Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Sherbet," Rhubarb is the tart one in the Sherbet series, perfectly capturing the sourness of a rhubarb stalk with a tiny dash of sweet. A beautifully fresh, green stem scent runs throughout the evolution, and it dries down to a creamier version--like an icy rhubarb sorbet mixed with a non-sweet (or overtly feminine) vanilla. We pick up a bit of wood (wenge) in there, too. Completely unique and unisex (go on, show us someone you know who wears a rhubarb scent), the tart green of Rhubarb is a study in converting taste into an exhilarating and crisp bottled scent. Extremely addictive, you just may drool a little when you smell this."," bergamot, rhubarb, litchee (aka lychee), orchid sap, cognassier flower, vanilla cream, wenge",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peppermint Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Sherbet," Brisk. Eye opening. The big burst of icy peppermint is joined by the far more subtle and green-smelling curly mint (from the spearmint family), with the bay rose making its entrance in the middle.  The far drydown is green and leafy.  Peppermint is a playful, cool scent that could invigorate an entire leather-clad Roman legion after a long march through the desert. We want to shower ourselves in this morning, noon and night!"," curly mint, peppermint, bay rose, white pepper, cardamom, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Honour Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Honour Man, the regal, dramatic masculine fragrance with a spicy, woody character, is heir to Amouage's ongoing (soap) operatic narrative that began with Jubilation, and continued on with Lyric, Epic, and Memoir.With an intensely peppery, dark opening, Honour Man creates olfactory storm clouds of disquiet, confusion, and drama befitting its back story, which was written by the perfume house's creative director Christopher Chong and inspired by Puccini's tragic opera Madame Butterfly.In Chong's melodramatic creative brief, Honour is the son of Madame Butterfly, Puccini's tragic heroine who commits suicide when the American soldier who abandoned her years before returns to take their son. Honour has come back, so the narrative goes, to confront his mother's tragedy and to come to terms with his identity.After the blast of pepper, Honour Man allows a fresh, rosy-floral note from geranium to peek through the dark clouds, followed by a succession of warm, woody, and spicy notes, including an intense patchouli that reminds us that Honour is still a fiery young man. Chong suggests that these comforting, beautifully blended base notes represent the reconciliation of our hero's troubled quest with his“filial elegy to honour his mother.” Its dry down does indeed feel like the denouement to a stormy, existential drama. Honour Man is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal."," Pink pepper, black pepper, geranium, elemi, nutmeg, patchouli, frankincense, cedarwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Honour Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Inspired by Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly,  Amouage Honour Woman is a delicate and even emotional rendition of white florals. (How could it not be emotional when it's based on the story of a heroine who kills herself when the American soldier she's pined for returns to her homeland to take their child?)“Death with honour, ” proclaims the heroine before dying, “when one can no longer live in honour.”Honour Woman opens with a tart rhubarb note and ends on a smooth base of subtly spicy resins,  amber and almost imperceptible leather. But the showstopper of Honour Woman is its floral heart. Gardenia,  which is often deployed to bring out its hot-house flower sultriness,  is here transparent and light,  flanked like a princess in white with her attendants lily-of-the-valley,  jasmine,  carnation and a very subdued tuberose. It's as if the passionate gardenia that Madame Butterfly's Cio Cio San once was gives way,  after Pinkerton's betrayal,  to a more stoic and elegant ”” if tragic ”” version of the flower. Eros transformed into Thanatos.As it dries down,  traces of rhubarb remain as its subtly spicy and warm base rises up. Even without the perfume's melodramatic back story,  Honour Woman's fragrant narrative is powerful on its own.Honour Woman is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal."," Pepper, rhubarb, coriander, jasmine, tuberose, gardenia, lily of the valley, carnation, vetiver, frankincense, amber, opoponax, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41831.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pardon Parfum Extrait,Nasomatto," ""The fragrance aims to evoke the persuasion of utmost masculine elegance and charm."" The Nose. Nasomatto's Pardon takes a dark,  woodsy richness and nudges it ”” ever-so-gently ”” into a surprisingly softer direction for the Italian niche line.As seems fitting with the name's connotations of polite society and gentility,  Pardon tones down the line's characteristic hard-core intensity. Unlike the brute,  narcotic beauty of Black Afgano or the forward wildness of Duro,  Pardon wants to persuade you of its masculine elegance and charm,  reverberating  creating a fragrance at once seductive and refined. Pardon,  like the solarized image of the dandy in its ads,  manages to evoke vintage while smelling supremely modern.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oudh Osmanthus Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," A lot of different perfumes called Oud claim they contain real oud. But what is important to know and to understand about this phenomenon is that most of them contain a synthetic base which reproduces the scent of oud and not the essential oil of oud itself which is very different. Mme Mona di Orio has studied both of them and the aura, the intensity, the beauty, the depth of the natural one is so fantastic, so magical, so mysterious and complex compared to the synthetic one which is simply a nice woody, leathery, spicy base without any vibration or any mystery.The first time Mme Di Orio smelt a sample of an oud essential oil, she was not at all convinced. There are many different qualities and origins, and as she was not seduced, she was not really interested to work with it. Last year her provider called her he just had received a new quality from Laos and this time when she smelt it, she was totally subjugated, intoxicated. Such an aura, such an essential oil, at this moment Mme Di Orio realized deeply why this product was so mystical, intimate and secret for thousands of years and through many religions in the world. Just to give an idea about its value: 18,000 Euro for one kilo-- about half a kilo compared to the price of gold.  She wanted to create something unique and thought about blending oud with somethimg rare and also precious, really different and unexpected like the absolute osmanthus from China. Created from a real oud essential oil, distilled by traditional hand methods in Laos; the source of oud is from a tree that has been replanted and cultivated under fair trade practices.The enigmatic and much-prized essential oil of real Oudh from Laos radiates from the centre of Mona di Orio's“Oud” casting a mystical spell on the other notes and highlighting their beauty. This fragrance opens with notes of hesperides and spices like elemi, petitgrain and green mandarin, mingled in a seductive encounter. Like a love potion with a radiant sensuality, the Oudh reveals one by one its troubling facets, alternated between animal, leathery, woody or balsamic. They embrace in a passionate vibration to a shadowy patchouli, a mysterious nagarmotha, a cedar from Atlas and a grey amber, a spellbinding formula rich and headily. Absolu osmanthus, the carnal flower with its warm mesmeric charming hints of jasmin, honey and apricot tempers the forceful power of the Oudh by its gourmand nectar.Please note: Oudh Osmanthus is the same fragrance formerly know as ""Oud""."," Elimi Phillipines, Green Mandarin from Calabre, Petitgrain Paraguay, Patchouli Indonesia, Absolu Osmanthus China, Nagarmotha India, Cedarwood from Atlas, Essential Oil Oudh Laos, Musc, Amber Gris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Back to Black Eau de Parfum - ...,By Kilian," When you call your scent“aphrodisiac”, you'd better be fairly sure you're not overreaching yourself. This latest release from By Kilian, is the sixth composed for the house by Calice Becker, is as head-turning a love potion as you're ever likely to spritz on. That is, if you enjoy the velvet-smooth, burning liquid umber of a great cognac and the hay-like scent of tobacco steeped in fruit and honey, or sipping a fine amaretto on a bed of moss. Who doesn't?Back to Black is an olfactory trip to Arabia – or perhaps to the exotica-mad 1920s, when Caron gave Tabac Blond to sultry, cigarette-smoking garÃ§onnes. The tobacco accord is slyly evoked through the herbal, faintly animalic scent of chamomile laced with honey; the honey in its turn conjures faintly floral aromas. Throughout its development, Back to Black runs through a palette of subtly gourmand flavors, from ripe, almost fermented raspberry to the dry cocoa powder of patchouli, along with almond and vanilla, without ever veering into tooth-aching sweetness thanks to the bitter, cooling effect of cardamom, coriander, vetiver and moss.  It stretches out languorously on the skin for hours, displaying its dark facets, leaving you hungry for more Arabian nights in its amber glow."," Bergamot, raspberry, blue chamomile, cardamom, coriander, saffron, cedarwood, vanilla, almond, vetiver, cistus labdanum, patchouli, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Bright citrus notes begin the olfactory journey with lime, mandarin & bergamot representing the sunny Calabria region of Southern Italy. Fresh green middle notes of Lily of the valley and herbal mint capture the unmistakable fresh breeze of Sardinia leading to a base of Cedar, amber and musk which round out the entire composition, creating a warmth that is only felt in the beautiful Italian countryside."," Bergamont, Mandarin, Lime, and Petitgrain, Rose, Lily of the Valley, Mint, Cedar, Patchouli, Amber and Musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Jade Eau de Parfum,Lubin," Marie Antoinette, the infamous young queen of France -- initially loved by the people for her charm and beauty, she became an international symbol of decadent luxury. Naturally her court had a royal perfumer, Jean-Louis Fargeon, and, naturally, he created an opulent, no-expenses-spared fragrance exclusively for her. Inspired by her rose-filled garden at Le Petit Trianon, this mysterious concoction was kept in a black jade flask which the queen kept with her at all times. Luckily for us, the perfumer had a young apprentice, Pierre Lubin, who paid closer attention to the formula for this elixir than perhaps he should have. Known in the House of Lubin for years as“jardin secret”, the formula has been newly revived with the help of one of Marie's black jade bottles that had been hidden away by a confidante. Fittingly, it is now known as Black Jade.Yes, yes, you say, thanks for the history lesson and all, but what is the juice itself like? Rich. Seductive. Alluring. As deliciously extravagant as you would expect from a queen notorious for her lavish tastes. This was a tribute to her beloved garden, so of course there are flowers, but this is no simple, country garden. These are flowers for royalty. Lush, satiny roses and frilly jasmine are embroidered with cardamom and cinnamon and exotic incense, then layered over a velvety base of patchouli, tonka bean, vanilla and amber. The opening is surprisingly cool and spicy, then as the floral heart opens and the roses bloom, it becomes warm and enticing and compelling. Exquisitely confident and unapologetically luxurious."," Galbanum, bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, incense, cinnamon, Indian sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31214.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tubereuse - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," When we think of tuberose in perfume,  we often think of the version most perfumers like to emphasize: its nocturnal version,  when it exudes its most intense scent. More discreet and docile during the day,  the flower some call“The Queen of the Night” emerges from its slumber when it's dark out to emit a deep and almost animalic aroma.In TubÃ©reuse,  Mona di Orio creates what she calls a“twilight tuberose, ” greener and fresher than its headier nocturnal incarnations but still intoxicating and rich. It opens with a beautiful and peppery burst of bergamot and green notes,  which almost gives tuberose the quality of having been tamed and made more transparent after a refreshing light rain.Soon,  the unmistakably narcotic tuberose slinks its way forward,  flanked by creamy notes from benzoin and amber matched with a milky nuttiness from heliotrope and coconut. Along with TubÃ©reuse's top notes,  the occasional sharp floral facet from heliotrope joins with tuberose's green facets,  balancing out its creamy and musky base notes.More approachable than its more femme fatale counterparts,  TubÃ©reuse nevertheless seduces. Perfect for tuberose fans that want a lighter,  friendlier,  more verdant interpretation of the flower."," Pink pepper, bergamot from Calabria, green leaves, Indian tuberose absolute, Siamese benzoin, heliotrope, Amber, coconut milk, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," When composing Vanille, Mona di Orio imagined a romantic back story involving an old ship from long ago, on its way to Madagascar or the Comoros Islands, carrying precious cargo: rum barrels, oranges, vanilla beans, ylang-ylang, cloves and sandalwood.Gourmand, smoky, and boozy with a subtle aromatic orange note lingering in the background, Vanille is one Bateau Ivre of perfectly blended notes that will derange your senses with its sensuality.Vanille opens with a shot of rum flavored with an orange rind and spiced with cloves. Amber and tonka further warm up this brew as ylang-ylang's sharp sweetness joins with rich vanilla. Gaiac wood adds incensey smoke as woody notes from vetiver and sandalwood help to create an elegant finish.But the real star of the show, not surprisingly, is vanilla. Instead of using ethyl vanillin, one of vanilla's main components that can come across as powdery and sugary, Mona di Orio used pure vanilla in this elixir. For a moment ”” amid this elegant orchestral arrangement of notes in the key of Vanilla ”” the pulpy, sensual creaminess of a split vanilla bean is right there in front of your nose. Delicious!"," Brazilian orange, Indonesian cloves, petit grain, rum extract, Bourbon vetiver, ylang-ylang, Indian sandalwood, gaiac wood, Vanilla absolute from Madagascar, amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51720.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetyver - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Vetiver is one of our favorite notes in perfume, and in Mona di Orio's VÃ©tyver, she wrests every facet she can get from its earthy-citrus scent, like a pianist exploring the intricacies of a particular key in a Bach piano concerto. Fresh, dry, peppery, hesperidic and even minty ”” VÃ©tyver marries the best Bourbon vetiver with notes that bring out its herbaceous-fresh qualities.In the top notes, blue ginger from Madagascar ”” which Mona di Orio distinguishes from what she calls the dustier and drier Chinese ginger ””  creates the olfactory hallucination of having the fresh root under your nose. Virginia cedar and clary sage absolute add a slightly bitter, herbaceous accord with a momentary glint of mint.VÃ©tyver then creates a sleight-of-hand impression of both dryness and freshness, like freshly steeped spiced tea with grapefruit zest just beginning to release its oils. This hesperidic note, concentrated rather than juicy and sparkling, adds a lovely counterpoint to the subtle but rich tonka and labdanum, which add weight and roundness to the perfume.Ginger and nutmeg become more prominent as the perfume progresses, and in its dry down, VÃ©tyver's paradoxical freshness and dryness linger delicately on the skin. A perfect unisex scent for warm weather, VÃ©tyver is a rarity: a clean scent that is also complex."," Blue Ginger, Grapefruit, Nutmeg, Vetyver from Bourbon, Ciste Labdanum, Musk, Patchouli, Absolute Sage.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51721.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Aoud Eau de Parfum,Montale," Experiencing Dark Aoud by Montale in its initial stages is akin to walking into a pitch-black room. Just as it takes a while for your eyes to adjust in order to discern the shapes, sizes, and nuances of the objects initially hidden in darkness, so too does it take time to realize that Dark Oud is more than a linear oud.A minimalist exploration of two powerful accords ”” oud and sandalwood ”” Dark Aoud starts out with the smoky, camphoraceous, medicinal aspect of oud on display, accompanied by a dry and elegant sandalwood. A sweeter, softer, and rounder sandalwood comes forth from its initial asceticism, rounding out the oud note's inky darkness and revealing its soft, even powdery spiciness. Although Dark Aoud gets softer through its long dry down, it remains an intense and mysterious presence on your skin."," Indian sandalwood, Oud, Black Pepper, Saffron, Vetiver, Teak, Leather, Grey Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35467.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hippie Rose Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," James Heeley's showroom in Paris is located in the Passage du DÃ©sir, and no address could be more suiting than“the alley of Desire” to the designer of such covetable fragrances. In Hippie Rose, the now-classic rose and patchouli accord is tinged with reminiscences of the journeys undertaken by the Flower Children and spiritual seekers of every decade: patchouli takes us to India, incense draw us into Himalayan temples, vetiver grounds us in the earth. It is from this earth that the carefree Hippie Rose rises, as soft and warm as the Californian desert wind in its silken amber and musk wrapping, but with a hint of toughness conjured by its woody-incense accord. Men and women both could take it on the road. Onward to the Summer of Love!"," Bergamot, green moss, Bulgarian rose, patchouli, incense, Haitian vetiver, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Pure eVe Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," Very simple and utterly beautiful. The inspiration for Pure Virgin was to create something as luxurious, comfortable and effortless as a soft cotton white shirt. It's a given that the simpler the design, the more the quality of the materials matters, and it is the outstanding quality of the ingredients that The Different Company uses that makes this simple concept soar. An exquisite gentle musk is blended with a subtle hint of white flowers and crisp cedarwood, then dusted with a nostalgic sweetness of calisson -- a traditional French candy from Provence featuring a smooth paste of candied melon and ground almonds, topped with white royal icing.  For those of us who have never encountered these enchanting confections, the sweet almond is reminiscent of marzipan, but with the added attraction of a luscious fruitiness which blends melon and citrus. Pure Virgin reminds us of some the beloved sweet musk fragrances of our youth – but improved and refined to suit our more grown-up selves. Airy, with the sun-warmed freshness of cotton shirts drying on the line and an understated sweetness that melts into the skin – this is the soft and sexy sweet skin scent we always dreamed of – and it's even better than we imagined."," Evanescent musk, light wind, linen flower, white rose, cedar, calisson",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25332.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," Kilian says the inspiration of Love (Don't Be Shy) was the marshmallow...a mouth watering treat for sensuous connoisseurs.  It's sweet (but not overly) and tender at first, a soft and sugared elixir mixed with the orangey delights of bergamot and neroli, warmed with caramel and vanilla.  It's almost nostalgic in some way...not an old fashioned feel but more like youthful exuberance which gains a gentle sensuality as it warms on the skin and the rose, jasmine and sweet notes combine.  Love captures that sweet transition from innocence to worldly, but it never crosses the line into beat-you-over-the-head sexy territory.  It's a memory scent, somewhere between a young girl's unicorn, rainbows and purple phase and her door slamming, love struck tirades...right in-between innocence and not."," Bergamot calabria, Tunisian neroli, pink pepper berries, coriander, honeysuckle, orange flower, orange water, Egyptian jasmine absolute, Bulgarian rose, iris butter absolute, caramelized sugar, vanilla absolute, labdanum, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Liaisons Dangereuses Eau de Parfum,By Kilian," By Kilian intends Liaisons to be one of the two unisex fragrances”” and it hits that perfect middle ground of beautiful scent experience with no obvious gender strings attached.  It's inspired by rose from Damascus and mixes this velvety floral together with indulgent fruits for a smooth, languid feel that brings to mind an alcove inhabited by casual lovers kicking back and enjoying the ripe fruits with no concern for napkins. Rich and complex, this is a passion-inducing mix tethered to earth with a tiny breath of Egyptian geranium and a brush of cinnamon and vanilla.  Indian sandalwood and a whisper of musk are surprising additions, and lend the plum, blackcurrant and prune notes a soft bed on which to recline, creating a sensuous, full bodied fragrance with gentle, rose-colored edges and a rich and perfectly ripe interior."," Coconut flesh, prune absolute, plum, blackcurrant buds absolute, crystallized peach, cinnamon bark oil, ambrette seeds absolute, rose Damascus, geranium bourbon, Australian sandalwood oil, oakmoss extract, vetiver java oil, clear woods, vanilla extract, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Week-end Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Previously called Week-end a Deauville Week-end is a song of freshness. A chic but relaxed style.  Week-end is composed of tender herbs mixed with peppermint, sweet basil and tarragon, which provide a floral note with strong tones of lily of the valley – at least, what is left of it, because lily of the valley, from which no natural essence can be extracted, is sorely tested in the production of scents. Not a day passes but legislation limits still further the molecules that can be used to recreate it. It's goodbye to Lilial, Lyral, Hydroxy and sweet bell-flowers! So I called upon Jasmin absolute, supreme of Ylang and resin of Galbanum to sustain the lily of the valley. A hint of apple and cardamom to invoke deepest Normandy. Helional and calone, more recent essences, recall the sea air of the coast. A touch of leather is a nod to the Norman stud farms. Cedarwood and white musk complete the picture.A delightfully fresh, green and floral scent that will transport you to a weekend in Deauville, the very essence of Normandy!"," Italian bergamot, petit grain, galbanum, lily of the valley, rose, mimosa, pepper, pink pepper, clove, oakmoss absolute and styrax balm.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31339.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vittoria Apuana Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"“The smells of the sun and the sea blend with sunny coconut and fresh fruit essences to evoke memories of my carefree childhood days. Sweet memories of picnics, and laughter at the seashore come slowly back to mind in this warm and exotic blend.”Sensuous and delicate, coconut and vanilla in a concert of freshness, in a cascade of emotions. Nostalgic memories of a perhaps untaken journey."," Sweet Brazilian orange, Sicilian mandarin, Coconut, Tahitian Gardenia, Banana, Madagascan Vanilla, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tirrenico Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"“Sitting on the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea, I breathe deeply and hear the pebbles washed by the waves and sand, while the white marble of the Apuan Alps shine behind me.

Wild herbs from the dunes mingle with a touch of the citrus fruits from local gardens in this harmonious and woodsy scent.”A fresh harmony of marine notes in a citrus cocktail with a fruity and floral aromatic heart. A touch of Philippine elemi and musk complete the fragrance."," Marine accords, bitter Sicilian orange, bergamot, Egyptian jasmine, Philippine Elemi oil, basil, Oak moss, sandalwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Versilia Aurum Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"“I practiced for a long time: I explored, smelt, created and discarded dozens of blends in my quest for a perfume that could evoke the spirit of that most noble of metals, gold. My Aurum is a jewel for the olfactory; to be worn with style on summer's sweetest evenings.”The first impression is that of a colorful basket of fruit: A joyful spray of orange, strawberry, plum. But the heart is an infusion of flowers, with the warm notes of heliotrope, the sweetness of jasmine and the emotions of rose that lead to a light vanilla base, touched by the balsamic reflex of tolÃ¹ balsam and the precious sensuality of grey amber."," Orange, strawberry, plum, rose, jasmine, tuberose, lily of the valley, heliotrope, orchid, vanilla, tonka bean, perÃ¹ balsam, tolÃ¹ balsam, sandalwood, white musk, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Versilia Vintage Ambra Mediterranea Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"“It was in the Sixties. During the summer I took a quiet ferry toward the islands of the archipelago. They were short trips in the search of those magnificent, solitary places set in the blue Tyrrhenian sea. In the small harbours, echos of fantastic stories, tales of distant lands, of flowers and perfumes; and merchandise of rich colours, of every kind and from every place. Then my journey continued on in my imagination, beyond the seas and the oceans, veering off through dream and discovery. They were the years of the New Frontier. The spirit of those times lives on, intact, in this perfume of mine.”The elegance of grey amber and the serenity of orange. The sweetness of ylang-ylang, the warmth of cedar wood. Gentle luminous notes, which evoke atmospheres of a calm deep Meditereanean."," Orange, coriander, ylang-ylang, jasmine, grey amber, benzoin from Siam, tolu balsam, cedar wood, patchouli, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Battito d'ali Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Battito d'ali means“the beating of wings” and implies an elusive, fragile quality – the delicate fluttering of a passing butterfly, or, in this case – angels hovering nearby. creating a magical fleeting moment of feeling protected and cherished and free of worries. Opening with a strong dose of myrrh, this initially seems very human - sharp and vaguely medicinal. Then the heart piercing radiance of ethereal orange blossom lifts us up and a delicate dusting of soft cocoa powder and sweet, gentle vanilla blend with the myrrh to create something heavenly. This is powdery and gorgeous – the gourmand notes are handled with a light hand and meld with the other elements without dominating them. This does not seem like eating a cake, but rather like passing by a room where many cakes have been baked and the sweetness has become part of the air itself. If you could wrap that air around you like a cozy blanket to fend off melancholy, it would be like wearing this exquisite scent.  No one knows what angels smell like, of course - and we imagine that everyone's angel would be scented differently – but the angels in our dreams will now smell like this -- dreamy, otherworldly and infinitely comforting."," Cocoa poudre, orange blossom, myrrh, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," The sharp, evocative scent of wood smoke  - triggering childhood memories of bonfires and burning leaves  - is at the heart of this eloquent scent. Arso means“burned” and the masterfully rendered smokiness works with the crisp cool scent of pine to conjure up a cabin in winter, with a crackling fire on the hearth. You can sense the snow piling up outside, the ice on the windowpanes, the wildness of the forest and the chill kept at bay by the blaze, but you also get the warm indoor scents of well-worn leather and glowing incense, as well as the fire.  The mood is calm and comfortable and safe – sitting with a glass of wine and good company while the winds howl outside.  This is perfectly suited for the strong, silent type - the sort of man who could build a house single-handedly and maybe even chop down the trees to build all by himself. Quiet, reassuring and powerful."," Leather, incense, pine resin, cedar leaves",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere Royale Eau de Parfum,Houbigant," First introduced in 1882, FougÃ¨re Royale completely revolutionized the world of perfumes and established modern perfumery as we know it today. FougÃ¨re Royale was the first“fougÃ¨re” (or fern-like) perfume ever created, and it established a completely new fragrance family, which remains the most popular one in men's fragrances.FougÃ¨re Royale opens with an uplifting cocktail of sparkling citrus oils, blending into an aromatic bouquet of Mediterranean herbs, where lavender and Moroccan chamomile oil dictate a buoyant tempo. A redolent heart follows, wherein a floral-spicy ""Rondeletia"" accord is revealed through rich geranium nuances and warm spices. A floral intermezzo showcases rare rose essences and absolutes, spiked with pepper, cinnamon and carnation.

La Belle Helene Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Osmanthus is one of the most unusual floral essences in the perfumer's palette, barely a flower really, but an oddly compelling hybrid of fruit and animal with its jammy apricot and soft leather facets. And for Parfums MDCI's 10th fragrance, Bertrand Duchaufour has brought out its beauty with two lightly gourmand accords. The name comes from by the classic French dessert Pears Belle-HÃ©lÃ¨ne, invented in the late 19th century by Auguste Escoffier, the first celebrity chef and named after Offenbach's 1864 operetta, a risquÃ© spoof on the abduction of Helen of Troy.  Of the poached pears, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and crystallized violets, the perfumer has only kept the pear -- a vivid, juicy pear adding its green, rosy and musky notes to the apricot in top and heart, underlined by a zest of tangerine. The powdery woodiness of violets, another facet of osmanthus, are boosted by pure orris butter and balanced out by their classic partner, rose; ylang ylang adds contrast and a rich floral fleshiness. The leather in the osmanthus is drawn out in the heart and anchored to the base by a burnt sweet, woody licorice accord.With its drop of citrus, rose and vetiver, patchouli and oak moss base, La Belle HÃ©lÃ¨ne is also, essentially, a chypre – the third in MDCI's line-up. But it is decidedly a non-classic chypre, silky, musky, juicy and light-hearted: in fact, like its namesake“the beautiful Helen”, it is quite the charmer. And like Escoffier's culinary classic, it's almost impossible not to bite into."," Pear accord, aldehydes, tangerine, lime blossom, rose essence, osmanthus absolute, ylang-ylang Madagascar, orris butter, hawthorn, Mirabelle plum, myrrh, vetiver Haiti, patchouli, cedar Virginia, amber, oak moss absolute, white musks, sandalwood, licorice wood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Antonia Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," The simplicity of the notes belie the perfection that is Antonia: a flawlessly executed performance in Green.

1 Parfum Extrait,Puredistance," One of the world's most exclusive fragrances, Puredistance I was created by a renowned perfumer Annie Buzantian.

The opening is bright and invigorating, a delightful amouse-bouche of zesty lime and citron spiked with a delicious dose of coriander before the main course of rich, robust vanilla. This is not a sugary, whipped vanilla – this is creamy, satisfying and custard-like, with a comforting, subtle sweetness. The vanilla is laced with a fresh woodsiness – not just wood itself, but the whole sense of the forest - the crisp air, the layer of pine needles and leaves covering the earth and the rich earth, itself. Jasmine, oakmoss, oak wood and vetiver are expertly blended to give freshness and texture to the vanilla, and additional richness comes from the luscious amber which rounds out the fragrance. It does not feel like the elements are layered on top of each other, but fused seamlessly together, like someone discovered an enchanted vanilla forest and simply bottled the essence of it.

And yet, in the newly re-opened Carthusian monastery, germinate the seeds of a significant new era.""In 1681, shortly after the reconstruction of the local  monastery, the Carthusian monks of Capri began with the production of scented water which they create using the help of herbs and spices from the local environs.

Aventus Eau de Parfum,Creed," The exceptional Aventus was inspired by the dramatic life of a historic emperor, celebrating strength, power and success. Introduced in 2010 and crafted by the deft hand of Sixth Generation Master Perfumer Olivier Creed in collaboration with his son Erwin, this scent has grown to become the best-selling fragrance in the history of the brand. Olivier created its iconic name derived from A (""from"") ventus (""the wind""), illustrating the Aventus man as destined to live a driven life, ever galloping with the wind at his back toward success. Aventus is a sophisticated blend for individuals who savor a life well-lived. What We Think A phenomenon in its own right, Aventus is a fragrance that is groundbreaking in its use of bright apple and pineapple notes."," Bergamot, blackcurrant leaves, apple, pineapple, pinkberries, birch, patchouli, jasmine, musk, oakmoss, ambergris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49365.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Knize Ten Eau de Toilette,Knize," Joseph Knize, one of its inventors lived in Vienna and was a supplier to the Royal and Imperial Court. The fragrance we offer, Knize Ten, has been available since 1925. The great author Hans Habe once said that, if he were cast away on a desert island, he would take Knize with him, since, for a man using a toilet water, it was really not so much a matter of undermining the morale of a beautiful woman than boosting one's own. The brilliant designer and poster artist Ernst Deutsch-Dryden played a decisive role in the composition of Knize. Knize was the most famous men's outfitter in Vienna. His shop still exists today with a much-admired interior, one of the great works of the architect and designer Adolf Loos. Knize Ten is one of the few fragrances to have distinct note of leather. Perfumers, who are capable of lyricism equal to that of wine connoisseurs, differentiate between the top, heart and base note of a fragrance and sense chords and cadences in the combination of these three. The top note of Knize is citrus-fresh with petitgrain, orange, rosemary and bergamot; the heart note is dry to woody with cedars and sandalwood, and the base note is leathery with castor and ambergris. In view of its age, Knize is not, of course, a fully synthetic perfume. It contains costly natural substances - patchouli wood, lemon, orris, clove and orange blossom amongst others."," Lemon, bergamot, orange, petitgrain, rosemary,  geranium, rose, cedar, orris, carnation, cinnamon, orange blossom, sandalwood, leather, musk, moss, patchouli, ambergris, castoreum and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
De Bachmakov Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," In a tribute to his Russian ancestry and to celebrate the year of Russia in France, the Different Company's co-founder (with Jean-Claude Ellena) and renowned designer Thierry de Baschmakoff joined forces with the perfumer CÃ©line Ellena to compose the fragrance which bears his name. De Bachmakov is not a literal evocation of Russia, but a poetic fugue on the magical moment when snow begins to melt on the steppes and the earth gives way to the rites of spring; on the first rays of sun to touch the Siberian forests swept by winds from Asia. The fragrance is as limpid and bracing as a shot of ice-cold vodka: along with peppery, aromatic bergamot, the lemony, anise-tinged shiso leaves and tangy, zesty cilantro lend their green, aldehydic fizziness to the blend, sweetened by a sprinkle of nutmeg. Freesia and its tender, white floral notes add a jasmine richness to the heart: as the fragrance evolves, its limpidity gives way to a surprising chalk accord produced by a blend of woody notes and musk. De Bachmakov is sap and snow and the first spring flowers: a cool herbal potion brewed near the Arctic Circle. It is also the very gifted CÃ©line Ellena's last composition for The Different Company: all the more reason to snap up this gorgeous and truly unique fragrance."," Cedar wood, bergamot, shiso leaves, nutmeg, coriander leaves, white freesia, soft chalk accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25325.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pink Quartz Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"“A fundamental stone of universal love and of infinite compassion: compassion towards oneself and towards the Other.  The Pink Quartz is linked to heart ""chakra"". It opens on dreams; it is inspiring, leading to the source of inner peace, of absolute calm and happiness.”These are the words Olivier Durbano wrote to describe his inspiration for his ode to the symbolism of pink quartz, the rare and light-sensitive crystalline form of rose quartz.  Rose is naturally the star ingredient here, a bright, fulsome one that is brought to bursting life in the opening by citrus, saffron and ginger and warmed at its heart with amber, patchouli and musk.  Heading into Fall and Winter we can see us keeping this love letter to the most perfect summer near to hand at all times.  It's as beautiful as a perfect Technicolor rose garden, it's as calming as a hammock lazily swaying in the summer breeze.  It's a lifeline during stressful times and drab, short grey days to a place where the sun shines warmly on your face and all is right with the world.”œFrom the stone to the flower, a love ritual of healing, a sacred procession, a conversion ceremony leading to such essential qualifies as purity, spirituality and compassion.  The rose remains a powerful symbol at the crossroads of our human emotions. The rose represents the dawn of a new era to be reinvented by all human souls together.”We couldn't have said it better ourselves.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36907.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sartorial Eau de Toilette,Penhaligons," After offering the masterfully sensuous Amaranthine last year to the ladies, Penhaligon's, as befits a traditional English house, has turned its attention to gentlemen. As an inspiration for Sartorial, Bertrand Duchaufour launched into an olfactory exploration of the Savile Row bespoke tailor Norton & Son's workshop. The odorant threads he's teased out compose a radically new vision of the most traditional masculine fragrance family, the fougÃ¨re.  Lavender acts as a reference both to the fougÃ¨re and to a typically English scent. Boosted by aldehydes and ozonic materials, it conjures the steam rising from hot irons on tweeds – fear not, there isn't the least hint of the aquatic in the blend --, the scissors and sewing machines. The dusty leather of club chairs and mounted hunting trophies springs from the combination of black pepper, gurjum wood, oakmoss and a leather accord. Patchouli and cedar rubbed in beeswax and honey soften the hard edges of the leather and metallic effects and smoothly wrap the blend, just as the waxed floors and cupboards bathe the tailor's shop in a warm, fatty-animalic glow. Duchaufour aficionados may recognize a trace of that signature green pepper note he's dropped into many of his compositions.As the quintessential English dandy and couturier to the Queen Hardy Amies once said:“A man should look as if he bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, then forgot about them.” That's Sartorial: tough and smooth, playful and elegant, impeccably tailored and as easy to wear as a bespoke suit."," Aldehydes, ozonic effect, metallic effect, violet leaf, neroli, cardamom, black pepper, fresh ginger, beeswax, cyclamen, linden blossom, lavender, leather, gurjum wood, patchouli, myrrh, cedar wood, tonka bean, oakmoss, white musk, honey effect, old wood effect, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Memoir Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," The releases from the house of Amouage over the past three years have had a uniting thread: uncomporomised richness and beauty.  Their new series Memoir presents a new chapter in this narrative as conceived by Creative Director, Christopher Chong. Turning the industry norm of a dominant woman's fragrance on its head, Chong instead conceived the two Memoir fragrances from an inherently male point of view. Together, the Memoir fragrances offer a new interpretation of the ”˜space' between man and woman, one that is almost impossible to resist.Memoir Man is a FougÃ¨re, one that fractures the standard mix of Lavender and Oakmoss into bright shards by the addition of Basil and Mint and the further aspect of Absinth.  Like a tray of unset gems the topnotes sparkle on the skin, leading into heart notes of Woods and a rich, smooth base of Vanilla, Amber and the traditional Oakmoss.  Inspired by Baudelaire's flÃ¢neur who walked the city in order to experience it, the scent brings to mind the richness that is Paris. As the ""Gentleman stroller"" he is a living duality: both observer and observed, spectator and participant. Won't you take his hand?"," Basil, mint, frankincense, lavender, rose, oakmoss, leather, tobacco, absinth, wormwood, sandalwood, guaiac wood, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Rose Vermeille Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," A divinely saucy rose scent that flounces and shimmies and flirts its way into your heart and never lets you go. The opening is bright and juicy citrus with a hint of lavender – and then the vermillion rose unfurls its luscious petals. As you would expect from Andy Tauer, the rose is exceptionally vivid and true – deep and velvety and spicy, with a peppery bite that acts as the perfect foil to a delicious, intensely concentrated essence of raspberry. This is a raspberry that you would pick in a dream – the most perfect berry of the summer - so bright and pure and sweet that you would cry if you woke up before tasting another. The sparkling rose and raspberry jam is folded into a creamy base of vanilla, tonka bean and smooth sandalwood, taking us right to the brink of gourmand, but not quite crossing over. There is definitely an edible quality to Une Rose Vermeille – it conjures up marzipan and meringue and Bavarian cream – but it isn't pure dessert due to the startling freshness of the rose and the deep purr of the sandalwood. This rose is not just charming and delectable and adorably feminine, but a bit naughty, as well. Stunning."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, rose, raspberry, violet, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Rarely do leather scents come across our path that put us in a state of delightful shock. Opening with a whiff of Gauloise-like smoke it quickly becomes toasted spices and sweet absinthe before the appearance of the leather. Neatly straddling the line between biker and Birkin bag, the leather is almost carnal in its depth. In these days of anodyne scents and trans-fat free lives this is a welcome walk on the wild side that on a man would be wonderful. On a woman? The only way to put it: Cuir is ruthlessly chic."," Cardamom, Absinth, Leather, Cade, Resinoid Opoponax, Castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio," Some musks are take-no-prisoners. Some are fleeting, or the scent of clean skin. Musc in Mona di Orio's deft hand is heartbreakingly lovely: the softest of rose, the most delicate of heliotrope, the most angelic of neroli. Were it a fairy tale it would be a princess, were it a character in a play it would be Juliet. The musk at the base of the scent implies the hidden carnality under all that radiant innocence, making it as captivating as it is unforgettable."," Neroli, Angelica, Rose, Heliotrope, Absolu Tonka Bean, Precious Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Les Nuits d'Izu Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," Inspired by indigo nights on the Izu peninsula, the Riviera of Japan, this takes the classic cologne structure and gives it an Asian twist. It opens with a piquant, shimmering yuzu note – similar to that of grapefruit with overtones of Mandarin orange. The vibrant yuzu leads us like a colorful butterfly to an ethereal garden of rose japonica and dreamy jasmine. A base of ocean moss and hinoki, the Japanese cypress used for building shrines, palaces and the finest soaking baths, adds intrigue and depth. A fresh blend of tart citrus, delicate flowers and precious wood that delights the senses. Perfect for cologne lovers who are looking for something unusual and new."," Yuzu, Rose japonica, jasmine, littoral moss, hinoki, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16463.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violette in Love Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Violette in Love arrives just in time for those hot summer evenings.

Uden Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff classifies Uden as a marine fougere, meaning that it smells of lavender, oak moss, and the sea. To us, although accurate in some ways, it simplifies Uden's unique complexity. If Uden is a marine scent, then its waters surround the Bahamas, where ancient traders traveled weeks across the treacherous Atlantic to barter for coffee and rum, both of which give Uden a delicious warmth. The rum and coffee are then packed in rough wood crates, which pick up the salty scent of the ocean as the boat's wooden timbers rock on the waves for further journey in the New World. Uden's ocean is the world of the seamen who risked their lives traversing the seas to bring the pleasure of the exotic to long ago drawing rooms.Uden opens with lavender and citrus, the harbingers of a traditional fougere. However, instead of traveling the clean, smooth path for which it seems destined, coffee and rum absolutes add their familiar, delicious notes. Combined with Uden's opening, the coffee and rum create an unfamiliar--yet completely tantalizing--heart to the fragrance. Uden dries down into a warm medley of wood infused with clean musk, providing a counterpoint to its sweet rum, rich coffee, and crisp citrus-lavender. Uden reminds us that wild worlds may belie the simplest pleasures."," Grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, Gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kobe Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff," In Kobe, Xerjoff created something unusual, yet somehow inevitable: a dry citrus, warm woody fragrance for men. Kobe smells like a finely crafted wooden box full of vividly scented citrus rinds. The wood of the box is of the best quality and from a mix of exotic trees, and the citrus peels inside are remarkably potent, but play more as spice than fruit. This marriage of tart and spicy with sweet and warm is what makes Kobe such a singular fragrance.Kobe opens with a bracing grapefruit rind note rounded out with petitgrain (an oil extracted from the green twigs of the bitter orange) and bright neroli. It feels fresh and alive, like opening a window on a crisp morning to an orange grove in early spring just as tight blossoms begin to push from the orange trees. After a few minutes, green wood begins to join the sharp citrus. The wood seems to age and sweeten over time to become more resinous and balsamic, transforming Kobe into an extraordinary, deep woody scent. It isn't just any wood, though. A vein of oud, an unusual, intimate aroma, runs through the fragrance of shaved rose wood. Fresh and warm, sweet and tart, Kobe is a fragrance for any time and anywhere."," Calabrese bergamot, Florida orange, Southern Italian neroli, Paraguayan petitgrain, rose wood, resins, oud wood, palisander, tonka, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oranges and Lemons Say The Bells of St. Clements Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," A traditional Eau de Cologne reworked to create a fresh, chic and contemporary, Eau de Parfum whose name is taken from the rhyme ”˜Oranges and Lemons' (circa 1740) that refers to church bells located within or near the City of London. Oranges, lemons, bergamot, and neroli combine with notes of Earl Grey tea and vetiver to create a new English classic."," Oranges, Lemons, Bergamot, Mandarine, Neroli, Petitgrain, Earl Grey Tea, Ylang Ylang, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ginger Ciao Eau de Parfum,YOSH," Who is Ginger Ciao? Vivacious woman about town? Daring international spy? Charming seductress of rock stars and heads of state? Whoever she is, if she smells like this, she can get whatever she wants. Deep, sexy, to-die-for black coconut is the star of this fragrance, adeptly blended with lush night queen, tiger lily, neroli and a splash of ginger and basil. Named for the heroine of a novella to be published posthumously, we suspect that Ginger is Yosh's own somewhat risque alter ego – but for now it remains a delicious mystery. An ideal scent for a walk on the wild side."," Black coconut, night queen, tiger lily, neroli, ylang ylang, ginger, basil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22830.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Naufrage Eau de Toilette,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," In French, bois flottÃ© is driftwood, buffed to silkiness by the sea; naufragÃ© is shipwrecked. Pierre Guillaume's unusual inspiration for his new scent is a black and white picture by the legendary Arles photographer Lucien Clergue. In the 1971“Nu au bois flottÃ©”  female flesh and driftwood mingle until their smooth curves form a visual continuum. In Bois NaufragÃ©, green and salty notes – one vegetal, the other mineral -- echo the memory of the sea that smoothed the wood, while the suave seawater facets of ambergris conjure sun-kissed skin, with a hint of tanning lotion washed away by a swim.  Born in the wilds of the Camargue where carob trees grow and flamingos come to roost near salt marshes along miles of deserted Mediterranean beaches, Bois NaufragÃ© offers an entirely new take on beach scents: mineral, vegetal, animal, as warm as the sand and as cool as the waves."," Fig tree, ambergris, fleur de sel accord (Vetiver oil fraction, orris absolute, mint, neroli oil, hedione)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34537.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetyverio Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," The core of Vetyverio features two of the vetiver's amazing properties. The first, from Indonesia, is earthy, rough and splendidly reminiscent of unspoiled nature. The second is more subtle and delicate and hails from the Caribbean. Less known? No longer! This vetiver from Haiti is the perfect blend for the musks that cut through the formula: it completes it, tempers it, and adds a new – and remarkable – quality to it.These essences are distilled by the two systems– steam and fractional distillation– and add up to almost an overdose (25% of the total), which avoids intensifying the blend with synthetic input. At the end, a few spices – carrot seeds with sparkling apricot essence, nutmeg and clove – add the last surprise. The majestic cedar wood's radical dryness structures the whole effect and the powdery musk draws a nothing but sensual line on the skin.Vetyverio is subtle, sensitive, and captures the power of unquestionable elegance."," mandarin orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, vetiver, carrot seed, apricot, nutmeg, clove, ylang ylang, Turkish rose, geranium, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48397.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

As neroli lovers know, quality is everything with this note, and this features a particularly beautiful neroli, introduced with bright lemon and bergamot and given a warm, sensuous glow with touches of amber and vanilla.

Orange Star Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes," There's a special corner of the fragrant firmament reserved for perfumes that go beyond the expected and transcend whatever notions pop into your head when you hear the name or read the notes.  Orange Star is one of those remarkable ones, a special fragrance bursting with twinkling citruses like clementine, red mandarine, lemongrass, and brought halfway down to earth with the barely reined-in lusty notes of ambergris, vanilla, patchouli and the resinous ambreine.  In between the heavens and earth are a clean and unfussy orange flower and a soft, powdered violet flower with just a tinge of wood.

Gardenia Petale Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," Unabashedly lush and feminine, GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale is perhaps the truest recreation of the gardenia's sensuality we've encountered. If you've ever dipped your nose into a gardenia's creamy petals, you know the narcotic opulence this flower possesses. In GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale, perfumer Nathalie Feisthauer captures all the stages of gardenia's life, from its almost citrusy, green bud to the delicate freshness of a newly opened blossom to the fulsome headiness of the gardenia in full bloom.GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale is an especially rich fragrance with grand sillage. We imagine wearing it on a summer's night when moonlight silvers the garden, or when the streets are carpeted in thick, white snow, setting off the fragrance's pure luxuriance. A dab of GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale behind the ears would perfectly complement the view of Paris from the Eiffel Tower, or dinner for two in a room bathed in candlelight. If ever a fragrance were made for grand gestures, it's GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale."," Green notes, citrus notes, lily of the valley, jasmine, and gardenia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orchidee Vanille Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," With OrchidÃ©e Vanille, Van Cleef & Arpels reminds us that the vanilla bean is the fruit of an exotic flower. Perfumer Randa Hammami heightens the seductively gourmand qualities of vanilla by blending in a hint of almond and chocolate, then brightening the fragrance with litchi. Balancing this mouthwatering composition is OrchidÃ©e Vanille's refined heart of Bulgarian rose and violet. The resulting fragrance has all the elegance you'd expect of Van Cleef & Arpels presented with warmth and openness.OrchidÃ©e Vanille's subtle, yet almost edible quality makes it the perfect fragrance for romance, but still approachable enough for daily wear. Its floral aspects lighten it enough for warm weather, but OrchidÃ©e Vanille's gourmand edge lends it the body to wear well in cool weather, too. Just a drop of OrchidÃ©e Vanille is all you need for people to lean in, breathe deeply, and smile, saying, ""You smell good enough to eat."""," Mandarin orange, litchi, bitter almond, dark chocolate, Bulgarian rose, violet, vanilla pod, cedar, tonka, and white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Homme Eau de Parfum,Costume National," Cool, calm and collected.The perfect poet, discerning connoisseur, Dominique Ropion is an oxymoron all of his own. Master of his art, still modest in spite of his success, he has an additional quality, one that is almost outdated these days: his kindness. How does that fit in with perfumery? Only because it makes his talent even more remarkable... Dominique Ropion trained at the legendary Roure Bertrand Dupont laboratory before going to work with Jean-Louis Sieuzac, one of the perfumery world's great technicians. His work is special because of the tension between precision and freedom. Homme is a modern and mysterious scent. The fragrance opens with a very fresh head made of grapefruit, cardamom and bergamot. The essence then plunge into the spicy heart of Cinnamon, Thyme and Cloves. In the end, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Labdanum gave depth and warm the general accord.

Fleur Nocturne Eau de Parfum,Isabey," This Nocturnal Flower should've been called China Blue – or rather, Bleu de Chine – after the fragrance launched in 1925 by the house of Isabey, lodged in a China blue bottle designed by the legendary Julien Viard. But when Isabey's owners decided to re-launch the scent, the name Bleu de Chine had been snapped up by another brand. So Fleur Nocturne it is, for a fragrance as tight-grained and creamy-smooth as the most luxurious silk crepe, flowing on the sinuous silhouette of a 1930s film star, its delicate apricot hues lighting up petal-flesh skin. Like Isabey's previous scent Gardenia, Fleur Nocturne revives the opulence and full-blown glamour of classic French perfumery: an aromatic shimmer of mandarin melding into the fragrant juiciness of peach and apricot underlining the fruity facets of jasmine; the slightly soapy, lemony touch of magnolia balancing out the lazy Southern Belle lushness of gardenia. Solar notes add a powdery, tropical-flower tinge to the vanilla drydown, barely darkened by patchouli.With its ample, long-lasting sillage, Fleur Nocturne will sail you through nights as tender and glorious as a Scott Fitzgerald heroine in the Riviera moonlight."," Mandarin, apricot tree flower, white peach, jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, solar notes, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aqua Universalis Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," The name is Latin for Universal Water, and the scent does what it says on the bottle. Francis Kurkdjian calls it the missing link between skin, clothes, bed linen and the air and he's spot on. This light, sparkling eau de toilette could be spritzed by anyone, anywhere, anytime – but you'll probably want to save it for your skin, since you can scent your house with the Aqua Universalis candle or incense paper, and launder your clothes with the matching detergent. With its sweet-as-a-kiss orange blossom and lily of the valley bouquet, brightened with citrus notes and a burst of aldehydes on a cottony cloud of white musks, Aqua Universalis is possibly the most refined interpretation ever of the fresh-out-of-the-shower, fresh-out-of-the-dryer smell. In a word, the ultimate stealth scent."," Bergamot, Sicilian lemon, lily of the valley, sweet mock orange, light and musky woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lumiere Noire Pour Femme Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," The name means“Black Light”, and black indeed is the light cast by Francis Kurkdjian on this thorny, Gothic rose chypre rooted in earthy patchouli...This isn't the first time that Mr. K has worked the rose-patchouli duet – Guerlain Rose Barbare and Juliette Has a Gun Lady Vengeance both feature what he calls“the attraction of opposites”. In LumiÃ¨re Noire Pour Femme, he intensifies the animal lurking between the deep red petals with the hay-tobacco facets of narcissus, a lash of indolic jasmine and a sprinkle of cumin. Pimiento heats up the stormy blend. This is perfume in the grand manner: unapologetically intense, romantic with abandon, and a perfect match for its virile soul mate, LumiÃ¨re Noire Pour Homme."," Cumin, pimiento, rose, narcissus and patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lumiere Noire Pour Homme Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Who says roses are just for the ladies? In the Middle-east, men have worn its essence for centuries, and LumiÃ¨re Noire Pour Homme's thorny rose is positively Byronic in its brooding, romantic virility. The green facet of the blossom and the dark, earthy whiff of patchouli are pulled into chypre territory by a lash of artemisia (also known as mugwort) – the bitter, green herb that dominates the top notes of Robert Piguet's classic Bandit or Caron's Yatagan – warmed by an oriental blend of cumin and cinnamon. This is a rose tucked behind the ear of Errol Flynn in his best swashbuckling mode, crushed against a young Marlon Brando's torso or ripped by the teeth of a carnivorous lover. Bask in this“Black Light for Men”, and you may never want to see daylight again."," Cumin, artemisia, rose, cinnamon and patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49806.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intelligence & Fantasy Eau de Toilette,The Beautiful Mind Series," Fragrance and memory are intimately bonded, not only because a scent can summon an absent person or a bygone moment, but also because memory – the recollection of thousands of notes and accords – is an essential dimension of the perfumer's art.  It is only fitting then that the Grand Master of Memory Christiane Stenger should be the muse of the Geza Schoen for the first installment of The Beautiful Mind series, dedicated to women gifted with exceptional skills.But fans of the Berlin-based perfumer may be in for a shock. Unlike the conceptual, minimalist Escentric Molecules scents he created, The Beautiful Mind is a sensuous, shimmering floral whose heart is the rare and precious absolute of tiarÃ©, a Tahitian variety of gardenia. Bergamot, mandarin and pink pepper brighten the creaminess of the tropical blossom; magnolia, freesia, osmanthus and hedione adorn it with fresh lemon, violet, apricot and green jasmine facets; musk wraps it in a huge, fluffy-powdery cloud. Cedar, sandalwood and Cashmeran ground it in a luscious, woody-balsamic base.  Geza Schoen calls it“an ode to summer and its memories”; we say that if this is what Ms. Stenger's memories smell like, we'd very much like her to remember us."," magnolia bud, bergamot, mandarin, schinus molle (pink peppercorn), freesia, osmanthus, rose oil, hedione, tiarÃ© absolute, cedar, musk, sandalwood and cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Al Oudh Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Oud may be the new black, as far as perfume notes are concerned. But Bertrand Duchaufour's take on the Ã¼ber-fashionable Middle-Eastern material lives up to the expectations raised by one of the most distinctive talents in the business.  Hot on the heels of Havana Vanille, this new installment of L'Artisan Parfumeur's groundbreaking Voyages series manages to combine Duchaufour's signature smooth, transparent woods with an animalic twist that should enthrall fans of oud, leather and spices alike.Cumin and roses sweetened with a bite of candied dates conjure Oriental delicacies between wisps of incense before the medicinal notes of saffron and oud rise to the fore. From then on, a soft but unmistakably natural oud takes center stage, veering towards leather before sinking in the inkiness of castoreum; civet adds a whiff of the beast to the brew.As Al Oudh slides into its drydown, the comforting sensuousness of a balsamic vanilla and tonka bean base turns its desert lion growl into a purr. Strictly for animal lovers.

Patchouli Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"“Patchouli is a material of great importance in the perfumer's palette. It plays as first violin in the orchestra. Among all the woody notes, it is the most sensuous. Patchouli evokes richness”, writes Patricia de NicolaÃ¯. With Patchouli Homme, the perfumer wanted to compose a woody oriental for men, but she ended up selling it to women too (which is why it will soon be renamed Patchouli Intense). And why not? This distinctly un-hippie patchouli straddles both sides of the olfactory gender spectrum, with Patricia de NicolaÃ¯ signature candied orange opening, sprinkled with cinnamon, sweetening the wedding of a deep, dark, earthy patch and its natural partner, rose.

Midnight Oud Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Romano Ricci conceived his opus as a European vision of oud that evokes the mysterious and intriguing woman who hides behind her veil. Midnight Oud is a love song written for that ancient musical instrument called Oud in a palace where the walls are rose petals, the air breathes golden saffron and the floor is scented with sacred agarwood.The heavy oriental notes of traditional ouds are represented here in a very wearable and refined manner. Midnight Oud is crafted as a bridge between the perfect balance of rose-chypre-patchouli and the purest Oud perfume note. It is an imaginary black flower with glittery saffron and soft incense notes, and the heavy Moroccan rose petals become a precious liquor laced with tobacco, amber, agarwood and dried fruits. The resulting scent is rich, velvety and opulent, finding the right harmony between the dark strength of Arabian perfumes and the modern idea of richness."," Moroccan rose, geranium, saffron, oud note, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, animalic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fat Electrician Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," If surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us, then Etat Libre d'Orange are the best gift-givers ever. What other brand would think to name a perfume Fat Electrician and base a new scent on inspiration from“a real story driven from the hazardous life of a young gigolo in the 70's in N.Y.C.”? And who else would be able to make this perfume so incredibly attractive and endlessly wearable? “White vetiver splattered on the asphalt of Time Square”, the fragrance juxtaposes the dry, earthy transparency of vetiver with the sweeter, balsamic smokiness of opoponax and myrrh. As the scent develops, it metamorphoses from the green, slightly salty gauze of a smell into something substantial and solid. Vanilla, opoponax and myrrh lend the scent a comfortingly fleshy, well-rounded quality.

Epic Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Inspired by Puccini's Turandot, Amouage's Epic Woman is a masterful fusion of the smoldering opulence and sensuality of Arabia and the lyrical intensity of China. The luxurious feel of the fragrance brings to mind the precious essences carried along the ancient trading routes.

Feminite du Bois Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," A milestone in the history of contemporary perfumery, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois can be considered as the template of Serge Lutens' trademark woods, fruit and spices variations. As the stories goes, Lutens, who had yet to launch his Salons du Palais Royal line, dragged the Shiseido and Quest teams to Marrakech to make them understand just what he was after: the quintessence of Atlas cedar. Christopher Sheldrake was the one who caught on; the great Pierre Bourdon completed the formula. The result was a breakthrough in the world of women's fragrances: a dark, honeyed, animalic wood rubbed with candied fruit, sweet balms and the slow burn of spices, encrusted with the amethyst flash of violets. Today, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois, the mother of all Lutens fragrances, has left Shiseido and found its true home. It has shed its strangely compelling dusty pink and plum flacon and Lutens has officially admitted that the formula was slightly tweaked to comply with new regulations, though he maintains that“the quality (creative and olfactive) remains authentic”. Aficionados may find the top notes a tad softer and the base a little muskier, but the fragrance is still entirely, deliciously FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois. A masterpiece."," Ginger, cinnamon, clove, plum, peach, orange blossom, violet, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wazamba Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Named after a musical instrument often used in initiation ceremonies in Western Africa, Wazamba symbolizes an inner journey characteristic of many great civilizations. This is an homage to the tradition of burning incense to purify oneself and one's surroundings. The fragrance combines the aromas of Somalian incense, Kenyan myrrh, Ethiopian opoponax, Indian sandalwood and Moroccan cypress into a composition of astounding depth. The bitter freshness of the coniferous note lifts the luxurious mix of resins, bringing a certain airiness and translucency into the dark and soulful blend.

Black Afgano Parfum Extrait,Nasomatto," ""The fragrance aims to evoke the best quality of Hashish. The result of a quest to arouse the effects of temporary bliss."" The Nose.The journey down to the inky heart of Black Afgano is a scent trip only for the daring among you. If you're a lover of light, bright and airy fragrances, then you'll want to stop reading right about...now.  Aiming to capture the qualities of hashish (without the police banging down your door), mystery and intrigue has followed this perfume since its inception. Rumors swirled that the debut of Afgano was held up for months due to the necessary procurement and smuggling of the.. eh,“raw material” (nudge nudge, wink wink). But it was definitely worth the wait. For those asking the obvious, no, it doesn't smell exactly like burning hashish... or so we hear, of course. Black Afgano is meant to capture some of the scent qualities and all of the effects of the herb: smoky, smooth and deep; a mellow yet deep and distinct fragrance high. The black colored perfume is a study in how to arouse the effects of temporary bliss, without all the side effects. Rich and hypnotic, with dark and dangerous notes, this is a beautifully relentless and utterly enveloping scent. Black Afgano is a strong smoke and incense fragrance that is surprisingly never overpowering. We can honestly say, this fragrance is dope.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tam Dao - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," In discussing Holy Grail fragrances with sandalwood lovers, Tam Dao is a name that comes up again and again. While not solely sandalwood, this blend of woods and ambergris features a gorgeous, dry sandalwood note that has earned it a devoted following. The opening is primarily cypress, very green and sharp, with a vaguely industrial feel. Then the blend of exotic incense-like sandalwood and softer, sweeter rosewood begins to develop slowly. The sandalwood becomes luxurious and creamy, with additional richness from the ambergris. Luminous and tranquil, with a meditative quality – Tam Dao smells a like a precious carved object. Even at its creamiest, it still has that authentic, dry bite of freshly-hewn wood and that transparent quality that is the hallmark of so many Diptyque scents. A must try for sandalwood lovers."," Goa sandalwood, rosewood, cypress, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48377.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'eau Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," The very first personal fragrance created by Diptyque, L'Eau is based on a 16th century potpourri recipe and is brimming with eccentric charm. It opens with a cobweb-clearing dose of clove and cinnamon with a touch of sweetness, like some marvelous 16th century rendition of red hots, and it stays spicy for awhile, until the soothing sandalwood steps in and the clove and cinnamon calm down. Please take note, the clove and cinnamon do not disappear – they just settle into a minuet with sandalwood, geranium and rose that is surprisingly genteel and elegant. It is easy to imagine wearing this fragrance in another time – riding in a horse drawn carriage to visit the country, pressing a single rose in the pages of a book as a memento of a chance encounter, following the elaborate rituals of courtship of an earlier age. Yet, it has a lively freshness and graceful warmth that translates beautifully to modern times."," cinnamon, clove, geranium, sandalwood, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48386.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Olene Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," White flowers without apologies. A lush cascade of wisteria, narcissus, honeysuckle and, most prominently, jasmine. A fierce, take-no-prisoner sort of jasmine, with an opening so boldly indolic that it almost gives you a head rush. As it wears on the skin this softens – the jasmine becomes delicate, the honeysuckle's intense sweetness mellows, and the fresh-cut narcissus and gentle wisteria make their presence known -- and Olene transforms into something absolutely beautiful: that perfect marriage of clean and sweet that is the hallmark of a classic white floral. Unlike many jasmine-centric scents, this has airiness and a hint of green that makes it appropriate for day as well as evening. Fresh and feminine."," wisteria, jasmine, narcissus, honeysuckle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oyedo Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," A vibrant and uplifting meditation on citrus, named in honor of Yedo (also known as Edo) the ancient name for Tokyo. A sparkling spritz of lemon and a squeeze of piquant green mandarine start things off with a jolt - fresh, realistic and dazzlingly bright. A delectable sweet orange joins in, dusted with sugar and nearly effervescent, and just when it seems like the whole thing might float off in a fizzy, candy-coated bubble, a bracing dash of cool thyme and tart tamarind keep Oyedo balanced and intriguing. Soft cedar wood acts as an anchor and adds a soothing and relaxing element to the shimmering citrus. This is a fragrance to calm frazzled nerves and lighten dark moods."," lemon, green mandarine, orange, tamarind, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48310.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Ombre dans l'Eau - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," An amazingly evocative scent, this transports you to an English riverside garden with overgrown roses and a tangle of blackcurrant bushes. This is startlingly green, almost astringent, in the opening and then the roses appear – fresh and vivid and beautiful. You can smell the wet earth of the riverbank and the berries weighing down the branches and the older petals that have fallen to the ground. The name translates as“Shadow in the Water”, and appropriately, there is a hint of melancholy here, a touch of the bittersweet.  However, there is also a rejuvenating freshness – perhaps the riverside garden is where we go to recover from heartbreak. This is a truly original fragrance – and an utterly beautiful one.", black currant leaves and Bulgarian rose,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Do Son - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque," Do Son is inspired directly from Yves Coueslant's childhood in Vietnam, where he grew up in HaÃ¯phong, a port in Northern Indo-China. Not far from there, in the little seaside resort of Do Son, his father had a pagoda built by the sea to go to and enjoy the sea air at the end of the day. Do Son recalls the memory of this place where flower fragrances dominate, in particular the tuberose, whose scent his mother particularly loves. In Do Son, the tuberose and Turkish rose bouquet expresses a sweet flavour freshened up with the orange blossom leaf and the rose berries. The white musk and the iris add a delicately powdered aspect to it."," tuberose, orange tree leaves, rose berries, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Reflection Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," The quintessence of masculine elegance, Reflection Man captures the seductive power of a man's inner strength. Edgy and classic, the composition juxtaposes coldness of citrus with the warmth of spices. Top notes of rosemary, red pepper and bitter orange leaves are chilly and bracing, a jolting breath of icy air in the midst of summer. The piquancy, which is apparent from the start, is rich and fiery, but never sharp, smoothed and softened by the presence of velvety orris and creamy ylang-ylang. Floral notes contribute to the sun-drenched, summery feel of the blend without compromising its undeniably masculine feel. The base of vetiver, patchouli and sandalwood, combined with the spices and orris, is dark, enveloping, and sensual. Virile and unexpectedly soft at the same time...a luxurious modern classic."," Rosemary, red pepper berries, bitter orange leaves, neroli, orris, jasmine, ylang ylang, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41819.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Complex Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," The mood is Gothic; the scene, a dungeon; the scent, an unsettling dip into olfactory taboos. This is leather at its darkest, spiked with metallic studs of violet, lashed with the aromatic essences of basil and sage. Musk straddles the boundary between the herbal and animal realms, before submitting to the whip of leather – tarry, bitter, almost licorice-like in its somber facets. An animal aroma of Oud wood suffuses the scene with the smell of hot, yielding flesh.  Incense fumes bathe the ritual in their searing whorls. Heed the stern command of Complex and let the ceremony commence. Just don't say you haven't been warned."," Sage, basil, violet, incense, leather, musk, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nobara-Cha roll-on Perfume Oil,Aroma M," In response to numerous clamorous requests, Aroma M announces the re-launch of one of her original eau de parfums, Geisha Nobara-Cha, as a perfume oil.The breathtaking opulence of a rose in full bloom is fused with rich incense. Unforgettable and striking -- like a gorgeous floral arrangement that uses a familiar flower in a completely unexpected, yet perfect way. While this formulation still recalls an overgrown field of wild roses and retains all of its flavors, refreshing notes of geranium flower grounded in soothing amber in their original proportions gives this fragrance a new potency in the absence of alcohol. Subtle in spite of the intensity of its elements, Nobara-Cha is seductive and unique."," rose, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11127.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tom of Finland Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Created for the eponymous artist's Foundation, Tom of Finland, is an ode to masculine beauty. It is that rare marvel, a clean leather scent. There is no tar here, just a delightful hint of smoke that lingers over a clear watery accord, blending the tang of lemon with the sparkle of aldehydes. The fragrance enhances the perfume of one's freshly-showered skin, revealing the true sensual power of a wearer's own aroma. We adore the aromatic, forest-like aspect of the fragrance: birch, pine, cypress and galbanum are simultaneously reminiscent of the great outdoors and, surprisingly in such a modern creation, of some of the most elegant masculine scents of the past. The softness of the base of suede, vanilla, tonka bean and orris is a bliss that lasts forever. A new cult favorite for the lovers of leather perfumes of both genders.Warning: Tom of Finland contains printed homoerotic imagery inside the box. If you are familiar with Tom of Finland  you already know; if not, you may want to find out before giving this as a gift."," Aldehydes, citron, leaves, pine, pepper, cypress, galbanum, birch, vanilla, tonka bean, iris, vetiver, styrax, suede, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Putain des Palaces Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," We are likely to fall for any perfume that makes us quietly hum Serge Gainsbourg's song in our rather imperfect French (and there aren't nearly enough of those!). And, when the perfume is as stunning as Putain des Palaces-- well, what can we say? We are madly in love! This sensuous fantasy of a scent is dressed for seduction: the powdery, rose-violet aroma of a lipstick, a hint of supple leather, a touch of spice, a subtle, insinuating animal quality of musk...the sensuality of silk and lace...the perfume of a temptress in a boudoir, coquettish, languid and a little dangerous. A sublimely feminine fragrance, an olfactory seduction."," Rose absolute, violet, leather, lily of the valley, mandarin, ginger, rice powder, amber and animalic notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Secretions Magnifiques Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Etat Libre d'Orange is a newly liberated olfactory territory, a land free of any taboos and preconceptions. A land where perfume is art and perfumers have free reign. It is only in free-thinking lands like this that truly original fragrances can be born, the ones that make us gasp not only because of the provocativeness of their concepts but because of the staggering innovation of their composition. And no scent is more original than Etat Libre d'Orange's bÃªte noire, Secretions Magnifiques. An ode to sensual pleasure, to the rush of adrenalin, to tension and relief, this subversive perfume tricks you into smelling things you had never expected to smell in a perfume. The insinuating, saline sensuality of its iode-blood-milk accord is extraordinary. It is a perfume-chameleon: on some it will smell astoundingly animalic and on others it will be almost childlike in its softness. A love-it or hate-it fragrance if ever there was one, some consider this a masterpiece of modern perfumery."," Iode accord, adrenaline accord, blood accord, milk accord, iris, coconut, sandalwood and opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin et Cigarette Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," A tailored suit, a fedora, a blond bob, scarlet lips and a cigarette – that's Jasmin et Cigarette. Etat Libre d'Orange's homage to femmes fatales of days past, this is a glamorous vamp of a perfume. Think Dietrich or Garbo. The jasmine note, sweetened by apricot and tonka bean, has a husky, honeyed quality akin to a sensual, throaty whisper. And just like Marlene and Greta, Jasmin et Cigarette has a distinctly androgynous side that coexists so unexpectedly well with the obvious femininity of the blend. Tobacco, woods and musk represent the touch of masculinity that was the trademark of the two great divas. Fresh and sultry, transparent and smoky, Jasmin et Cigarette is a stunning tribute to the allure of contrasts."," Jasmine absolute, tobacco, hay, apricot, tonka bean, turmeric, cedar, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Yes I Do (formerly Don't Get Me Wrong Baby) Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," With its breezy lily of the valley, airy jasmine, clean orange blossom and lady-like aldehydes, Yes I Do is prim, proper and well-behaved. The Good Girl vibe of the scent is shocking given the suggestive name, and therein lies the genius of the fragrance. But is the girl really all that innocent? Under the angelic whiteness of cool florals, isn't there hidden a dark, edible, subtly animalic depth of patchouli, amber, cacao and marshmallows? Smell for yourself and find out. We already know how the story ends but we don't smell and tell."," Jasmine, aldehydes, lily of the valley, orange blossom, amber solar accord, patchouli, cacao, marshmallow.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Vepres Siciliennes Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," With VÃªpres Siciliennes, a verdant fruity chypre, Perfumer Jeanne-Marie Faugier embarks upon a different olfactory journey”” a journey to bella Italia. As the heat of the afternoon gives way to the early evening, it is a magical hour: Night is falling soon. The intoxicating smell of the orange orchards, still warm from the sun, rise up to meet the mysteries at hand for the evening, as lovers wait for the languor of evening shadows, and assassins heed the gathering darkness. Inspired by Verdi's opera of the same name, this fragrance honors the duality of man's nature”” the peaceful time of prayer and the uncertain dangers that await.The fragrance begins as a haunting, rich, lovely ode to an Italian tapestry of scent as we stroll through the orchard, with its smell of peppery citrus and crushed green leaves.  Unexpectedly we encounter scents drifting from a distant garden on the quiet breeze... the warm, sensual flowers of jasmine, magnolia, ylang ylang and heliotrope mingling with the earthy woods of cedar and oakmoss. The fragrance, like the day, then takes an unexpected twist-- instead of a drydown of woods, only then is the secret, surprising heart of the fragrance revealed: Fruits and flowers when we least expect it.  An early evening banquet is set out: Osmanthus, raspberry, clove, plum and peach entice us to linger, even as the shadows grow long beside us and the day grows still. It is the time for Vespers, and all is not what it seems.  An unexpectedly rich scent that evolves continually and delightfully for hours."," mandarin, grapefruit, peach, pepper, green leaves, cardamom, muguet, magnolia, jasmine, ylang ylang, rose, tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus, raspberry, cloves, plum, coconut, musk, amber, oakmoss, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sublime Balkiss Eau de Parfum,The Different Company," Balkiss was the name of the Queen of Sheba, the lover of King Solomon. But don't expect a spice-laden oriental. And though CÃ©line Ellena, who co-founded The Different Company along with her father Jean-Claude and legendary bottle designer Thierry de Baschmakoff, touts Sublime Balkiss as a chypre, don't expect a classic chypre either.The canonic bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss trilogy has been set aside and the scent retains only the structure of the chypre: mouthwatering bergamot, astringent cassis and blackberries stage the juicy, slightly raspy opening burst; damascene rose, lily of the valley and lilac provide the soft floral heart, with a lashing of green violet leaves and heather; two different types of patchouli grounding the composition. One is the traditional essence of patchouli; the other, more unusual one, is a fraction of patchouli essential oil, which brings out the cocoa facets of the heart notes (a chocolate-like effect similar in Serge Lutens' BornÃ©o 1834).With its berry top notes and patchouli base, Sublime Balkiss is sure to appeal to Angel fans – if you've given up on Thierry Mugler's classic because it was too popular, or too potent, you'll find the familar accord played in the lighter hand of the trademark Ellena style."," Bergamot, cassis, blackberries, rose, lily of the valley, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli fraction, patchouli essence, heather.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25322.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nuit de Cellophane Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Cellophane night? The name was meant to shock, says the enigmatic maestro of the Palais Royal -- though what it alludes to is simply the material used to wrap bouquets in flower shops.At first sniff, you may think Serge Lutens has gone mainstream. Nuit de Cellophane is, undeniably, a fruity floral drowned in a cloud of fluffy musk. But smell more closely, and the little night music running through the Lutens opus will make itself heard: the stained-glass light of mandarin, warmed by the solar cinnamon roundness of myrrh, drowns the dusk-blooming, indolic jasmine in sunset hues. A slight mentholated whiff betrays a roving tuberose throwing her green flash.Chinese osmanthus, with its juicy apricot sweetness and suede-like facets, is offset by the clove-y warmth of carnation and the milky lushness of almonds. A touch of lily adds smokiness to the blend, melding into the woody, creamy sandalwood base drowned in honey. A deceptively innocent, multi-textured fragrance whose carnal whispers will draw you into the luminescent sparkle of a cellophane night..."," Green note, fruity note, jasmine, osmanthus, carnation, lily, muscs, almond, wood, honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36128.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peche Cardinal Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," PÃ©chÃ© Cardinal is an enticing froth of sinful and sweet, blending luscious fruits and mesmerizingly heady white flowers into a siren song. Warm, rounded and alluring, this Bellini-esque scent opens with a juicy, light-hearted sweetness that belies its intoxicating nature. As it warms on the skin, it becomes boldly flirtatious”” this is the perfect scent for the belle of the ball. PÃ©chÃ© Cardinal (translation: Cardinal Sin)  opens with the apricot-hay sweetness of davana combined with the silken fur of ripe golden peaches and creamy coconut. The tart fruitiness of blackcurrant and prune keep the fragrance from becoming too sweet, allowing the cool, fresh-from-the-flowershop tuberose to shine from the heart of the composition. White lilies add an additional, slightly green aspect to the scent. The cedar, sandalwood and musc provide a quiet contrapunto to the fruits. An unabashedly romantic fragrance for those daring enough to wear it."," Davana, peach, coconut, blackcurrant, tuberose, prune, lily, cedar, sandalwood, musc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dia Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Can't make it to Paris this spring? Dia Woman may be the next best thing. Like a warm April afternoon in the Jardins de Tuileries after a morning rain,   Dia blooms with sophistication,   freshness,   and Right Bank luxury. On first sniff,   Dia's unmistakable French heritage shows in a tingle of fig and bergamot. Almost immediately,   the fragrance deepens to welcome an armload of fragrant spring flowers,   including rose,   jasmine,   neroli,   and iris,   all smelling as if they're drenched in rain water. Running through Dia Woman's floral richness is a grounding of incense and sandalwood,   reminiscent of the dim churches tucked between the city's lavish boutiques. We imagine a beautiful woman meeting her lover for lunch at the Plaza AthÃ©nÃ©e. He leans forward. ""You smell so wonderful,  "" he says. ""I know,  "" she says in reply."," Fig, Cyclamen, Bergamot, Tarragon, Sage, Violet Leaves, Bush Peach Blossoms, Rose Oil, Orange Flower, Peony, Orris, White Musk, Incense, Vanilla, Heliotrope, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Gaiac Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dia Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage," In Dia Man, Amouage created a fragrance that perhaps of all its offerings most closely reflects the spirit of its home country, Oman. Dia Man mirrors the arid wilderness of the desert, the spices of Zanzibar, and the freshness of the open Arabian Sea. Dia Man's opening is dry and woody, reminding you of ancient caravans trundling along gravelly dunes. Soon the fragrance deepens and you are sipping spicy tea in a market, the scent of frankincense, plums, and fresh flowers drifting in from the market outside. As the fragrance settles, you are at the ocean and the smell of wet vetiver freshens the air. Amber and patchouli very gently warm the chill ocean breeze. Dia Man is the scent of an iconoclast--a man who appreciates luxury, yet has an undeniable sense of adventure."," Cistus, Bigarade, Cardamon, Frankincense, Labdanum, Peony, Ylang Ylang, Orris, Plum Blossom, Vetyver, Leather, Patchouli, Amber and Palisander",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage," Every woman needs a Grand Perfume in her arsenal, a fragrance that will make her feel like Jean Harlow in a satin gown descending a marble staircase. Gold Woman is just that fragrance. Legendary perfumer Guy Robert created Gold using the highest quality ingredients that money could buy. He artfully melded more than 120 essences into an opulent perfume he calls the ""crowning glory"" of his career. Gold opens with a champagne-like burst of greens and lily of the valley, giving way to a floral symphony rich with rose and jasmine but so lushly orchestrated that it's difficult to isolate any one note. As Gold settles, it begins to purr with the warmth of sandalwood and frankincense. Gold lasts for hours and hours, and a little goes a long way. Gold Woman is a marriage of French tradition and Omani luxury that no 1930s movie, no matter how glamorous, could top. So, go ahead. Dab a few drops of Gold behind your ears and make an entrance they'll never forget.Gold Woman is housed in majestic gold glass bottle and the cap is crystallized by a single white opal Swarovski jewel."," Frankincense, Rock Rose, Lily of the Valley, Orris, Jasmine, Myrrh, Musk, Cedarwood, and Sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41810.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanitas Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Just what we're always on the look-out for – a vanilla scent that is sophisticated and complex, but still delicious and comforting. Vanitas opens with a chilly dose of myrrh, which is almost medicinal at first, but as it warms on the skin, its deep, resinous sweetness emerges and blends with the creamy warmth of truly excellent vanilla. Delicate orange flower enhances the high notes, and sandalwood adds a dark golden bass line – but the heart of this accord is the exquisite pairing of vanilla and myrrh. The myrrh adds mystery to all the luscious qualities we love in vanilla and brings in a dark sweetness that is not at all food like. Happily, it adds just enough of a cool edge to keep things intriguing, but not enough to overpower our beloved vanilla.  Soft, enveloping and tantalizing - this is the grown-up vanilla we've dreamed about."," vanilla, myrrh, orange flower, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33926.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Makassar (formerly Bois de Santal) Eau de Parfum,Keiko Mecheri," A subtle sandalwood that has all the personality of the wood softened with osmanthus, Makassar is a soft sandalwood with a floral-meets-incense feel that renders it perfectly wearable no matter the season or time of day.   The Indian sandalwood is slightly smoky and perfectly offset by the crisp lightness of osmanthus, while ambergris and tonka lend a touch of sweet warmth.  Never heavy or complicated, Makassar is one of those rare sandalwoods that can be enjoyed in the height of summer or the depths of winter...a truly beautiful fragrance that announces its presence with subtlety and playful sensuality rather than blatant beat-you-over-the-head raw sexuality.This fragrance was formerly called Bois de Santal."," sandalwood of Mysore, white Chinese osmanthus, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16442.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The result is so much more than just vanilla: it is a complex blend in which woods are as prominent as the title note. The deep, resinous banana wood is paired with hay absolute, and the union produces a wonderfully rich, dark accord that is simultaneously sensual and comforting. We hesitate to call this sultry vanilla fragrance“gourmand”; its edible quality is of the most abstract and the most exotic kind. Sweetly-spicy, indolent and animalic, this ferocious vanilla is a graceful predator ready to pounce.

Jus d'amour opens with coco palm – sweet, but not cupcake-topping sweet. This is a dark and dusky coco palm, and there is a brief moment when it meets the mysterious and green aqualeaf accord that makes us wonder if we might be headed someplace edgy. Then the most soothing, enveloping woods appear, and it is clear that the place we are headed is the coziest chair in the room, complete with a cashmere throw. We can feel the knots in our neck begin to unwind, as creamy Tahitian vanilla wraps itself around mesmerizing sandalwood.

Then the most soothing, enveloping woods appear, and it is clear that the place we are headed is the coziest chair in the room, complete with a cashmere throw. We can feel the knots in our neck begin to unwind, as creamy Tahitian vanilla wraps itself around mesmerizing sandalwood. Even the lilting violets and jasmine snuggle into the tranquil blend instead of floating above it. Sophisticated and serene, with a warm, soft sweetness that takes the edge off a stressful day. Just what we needed."," coco palm, aqualeaf accord, night-blooming jasmine, violet, Tahitian vanilla, sandalwood, cashmere woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Lyric for Women Eau de Parfum,Amouage," With Lyric Woman, Amouage is redefining the use of rose in perfume by rendering the traditional note in a completely unique manner. Spicy and resinous, Lyric Woman is an oriental rose, rich, complex and intricate. The piquant character of the composition is apparent immediately: the top notes blend bracing bergamot with tangy ginger and contrast this cool accord with warm, velvety spiciness of cardamom and cinnamon. The regal, crimson rose, surrounded by a creamy, opulent posse of ylang ylang, jasmine and orris, retains that spicy character in the heart of the fragrance, due to the presence of fiery geranium. The base of the scent, which includes the luxurious signature note of Amouage, frankincense, finishes the beautiful melody on a deep, sensual note. The drydown of woods, resins, vanilla and patchouli, paired with rose, is decadently rich, the epitome of Oriental luxury. In its structure, Lyric is a floral fragrance, but one that introduces a dark intensity and modernity not normally associated with this genre - a perfect illustration of femininity, strength and passion."," Bergamot, spicy cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, rose, angelica, jasmine, ylang-ylang, geranium, orris, oakmoss, musk, wood, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Its cap is solid white ceramic with a crackled glaze which signifies the idea behind China White: strength of fragility.  China White is indeed intoxicating, a soft and mesmerizing mix of powdery soft florals , a little wood, and something we can't quite put our finger on... a key element that intrigues us with its almost sharp, edgy, almost leather-like nuance and makes China White so very... addictive (sorry, couldn't resist).  As usual, Nasomatto leaves the notes undisclosed so that every scent experience can be uniquely interpreted by the wearer.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

It's subtle but not weak, a softly clean, gently warm scent that may seem easy to pull off in a perfume but is surprisingly tough.  How do you create a perfume that smells like you'd want your skin to smell like without perfume?  How do you make people think of freshly cleaned skin rather than the individual ingredients that make up a fragrance?  The answers to these questions are all in Silver Musk.  It's a perfect skin musk that has a huge appeal due to its subtle, sensual nature.  It never tries...it just is.  Utter perfection, and if everyone smelled like this naturally, we'd be out of business.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

It's untamed and virile, a raw and gorgeous fragrance that doesn't give a damn about smelling pretty or frou frou or like a vase of flowers...like its counterpart, it revels in its masculinity and doesn't give a flip what you think about it.

Rounding out this whole breezy cool fragrance are soft Haitian vetiver and coral amber.  No. 6 is a definite must-try for admirers of invigorating, modern scents and folks who hunger for a fragrance that is truly unlike anything out there."," Fennel, Italian Bergamot, Lemon Murcia from Spain, Cardamom, Quince, Licorice Bark, Spider Orchid, Haitian Vetiver, Amber, Cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 7 Eau de Toilette,Cereus," High quality bergamot, cedar and pure mandarin oil are the opening notes of No. 7, which come together in a fresh combination tinged with green.  At its heart is an enveloping violet-tinged jasmine mixture, but we find that it's the warm base that captured our hearts and made us worshipping minions of No. 7.  Skin musk, worn leather, natural tonka bean and Australian coach wood reveal a sensual and sleek masculine nature that's just so...well, the only word that truly comes to mind is slang from our friends in the UK: phwoar!  The American equivalent is somewhere between hell, yeah! and holy somethingorother! but trust us, No. 7 is so fresh, comforting and sexy at the same time, don't be surprised if you see jaws drop and strange words being uttered wherever you go."," Bergamot, Mandarin Oil, Clary Sage Absolute, Pepperwood, Jasmine, Saffron, Pomerose, Violet, Musk, Leather, Tonka Bean, Australian Coachwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Domenico Caraceni 1913 Eau de Toilette,Domenico Caraceni," Domenico Caraceni is known as the father of Italian tailoring, so it goes without saying that any fragrance bearing his name would have to be as elegant and unique as a impeccably fitted bespoke suit. Luckily, Domenico Caraceni 1913 does justice to its namesake with an elegant, chypre-inflected men's scent with the character and individuality to make anyone who wears it feel like it was made especially for them. While classically structured with top notes of citrus, a heart of geranium and a base of mossy woods, Domenico Caraceni 1913 has a distinctly modern, even edgy feel, largely because of the presence of a distinct and stunning frankincense note. The note, apparent from start to finish, combines beautifully with the citrus top notes, creating an effect that is husky-sweet, almost smoky.  In the heart of the fragrance, it enriches the geranium, rose and tobacco, adding an earthy, spicy undertone to the sultry mix. The piquancy is further emphasized by the cypress note, with its gloriously mentholated, almost pine-like aroma. Although originally meant for men, Domenico Caraceni would be as wonderful on a woman as – you guessed it! - an impeccably tailored suit."," Petit grain, styrax, geranium bourbon, neroli bigarade, rose, tobacco, cypress, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aoud Queen Roses Eau de Parfum,Montale," Aoud Queen Roses, Montale's breathtaking classic, is the perfume that started our rose oud obsession. The regal beauty of the union of spicy, earthy, leathery oud and the sweet, luscious roses is rendered here with the masterfulness that set the standard for other creations in this sublime genre. The sultry ripeness of roses is highlighted by the creamy muskiness of hibiscus, which lends the composition a soft, insinuating sensuality. The fragrance darkens gradually as the notes of oud, precious woods and leather become stronger, until it becomes truly nocturnal in feel...evocative of a secret garden of an opulent Eastern palace...with roses mingling their intoxicating aroma with the raw pungency of earth... with Scheherazade whispering softly in our ear the tales of fantastic journeys and incredible passions. Exquisite, truly fit for a Queen and highly recommended."," roses from Grasse and Arabia, hibiscus from Guinea, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35432.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lady Vengeance Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Elegant yet bristling with wild, thorny rose, Lady Vengeance hides its claws under velvety rose petals, soft patchouli and seductive vanilla. She's not a dominatrix in leather...this beauty is clad in a waist cinching, blood red corset, silk stockings and carries a satin whip. Sly and charming under her rosy exterior, Lady Vengeance lays waste to the non-believers in the seductive powers of rose by wrapping her legs around an earthy patchouli and dipping her fingers in the time honored man slayer of golden vanilla, a combination that's impossible to deny. Resistance is futile!"," Bulgarian rose, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cologne Cedrat Eau de Cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Said to be Patricia de Nicolai's personal favorite, Cedrat was inspired by the aroma of citron, a citrus fruit that is similar to lemon. The fragrance is wonderfully fresh, like a welcome wave of cool air or a gulp of ice-cold water on a very hot day. But what we especially love about CÃ©drat is its unexpected spiciness, which puts an intriguing twist into the traditional eau de cologne composition. Black pepper adds zing to cedrat's zest, enhancing its freshness and enriching the blend. The dry woods and patchouli create depth and make the cologne exceptionally long-lasting. Bright and bracing, Cedrat will become the fragrance to which we'll be turning a lot in the coming months, to fight the winter blues."," cedrat (citron), bergamot, black pepper, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31320.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fig Tea Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Finally here comes a fragrance to delight the fans of non-green, fruity figs. The leaves and the twigs of a fig tree were abandoned in favor of the divine, nectarous, darkly-sweet fruits. The figs in Patricia de Nicolai's rendition are ripe and marvelously soft, oozing ambrosial juice...The osmanthus, with its slight apricot-like undertone, and the wonderfully boozy davana make the smell of figs not just mouthwatering but actually intoxicating...To keep the lush sweetness in check, the creator balanced the figs and the flowers with a tea note. Dry and slightly smoky, black tea turns the decadently luscious composition into a blend of utter elegance. A treat for the fig-scent connoisseurs and the lovers of refined and unusual fruity perfumes."," figs, osmanthus, davana, tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31321.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleurs d'Oranger Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," In a word: masterpiece.  There is no other way to sum up Fleurs d'Oranger.  This is truly a legend in the Lutens line, the fresh yet decadent scent of an orange grove in full bloom, blossoms falling like rain as a warm breeze swirls the petals in the air.  The heady and sweet scents of orange blossom, white jasmine and tuberose are highlighted with a hint of citrus and enhanced with just the tiniest wisps of warm spice to create a perfume that is ever-changing and, once you live with it awhile, you begin to sense its ultra complex nature.  Fleurs d'Oranger is a floral fantasy that is even more beautiful than any amount of flowery prose can hope to relay...it's a rare fragrance that could be worn every day and you'd never tire of it.  Gloriously feminine, Fleurs is not“cute” nor is it cloying or overpowering...it's pure French elegance meets a wild romp in an orange grove, a dream of a perfume that will make you close your eyes, breathe deeply and just...smile."," Orange blossom, white jasmine, Indian tuberose, white rose, citrus peel, hibiscus seeds, cumin, nutmeg",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36115.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Clair de Musc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," There are musks that are sultry and carnal, the dirty, animalic musks full of heavy-lidded sensuality. Clair de Musc is something entirely different, a musk that is luminous and transparent, with the delicate, pure, radiant beauty that is nothing short of angelic. The fragrance begins with a soft citrus accord of bergamot and neroli. The tender floral notes, the light jasmine and the gentle iris, grace the heart of the scent; the base is warmed by a subtle note of sandalwood. The citruses, flowers and woods are understated, beautifully muted, allowing the silvery-white, lunar musk to shine in all its ethereal, seraphic glory.  A sublimely wearable, wonderfully versatile fragrance that is bound to delight the musk connoisseurs and to convert the musk-wary into ardent followers."," Musk, bergamot, neroli petals, Tuscan iris powder",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Un Bois Vanille Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Picture yourself far away from the city, surrounded by tall, hundred-year-old trees, the hush of the forest broken by the crackling of a small fire. In the air there is a nostalgic blend of burning wood and molten sugar. Yes, we are picturing a marshmallow bubbling and turning dark golden on the end of a stick, and it's making us extremely happy, but this scent is much darker and richer than that simple image from childhood first implies. The wood is deep and pungent and singed at the edges, and the vanilla is rich and enveloping, its sweetness tempered with bitter almond. There is the tantalizing aspect of something caramelizing – not caramel candy, this is not  a candy sort of scent  -  but the far more mysterious fragrance of sweetness morphing and evolving as it is licked by flame; the indescribable lusciousness of something almost, but not quite, burning. Complex, smoky and warm, this is a vanilla with a definite edge, suitable for grown-ups of all sorts. Dangerously delicious."," Black vanilla absolute, licorice, sandalwood, coconut milk, beeswax, caramelized benzoin, bitter almond, Gaiac wood, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36113.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Datura Noir Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Seductive and mesmerizing, this takes the familiar theme of white flowers, coconut and vanilla and puts a dark and mysterious spin on it. It is still an enchanted tropical isle, but it is midnight and we're not sure exactly what is waiting for us in the deep blue shadows. A wickedly insistent blend of datura, osmanthus, heliotrope and tuberose beckons us to go ever deeper into the dark heart of the jungle. Voluptuous tonka and vanilla lull us into a dreamy haze, while unexpected touches of bitter almond and myrrh keep us wary and on the lookout for danger. Datura Noir does not reveal itself as a straightforward journey, but as a series of flickering impressions: one moment purely floral, the next apricot sweet, and the next richly gourmand.  Somehow they all fit together beautifully, like the elements of like a particularly wild and vivid dream. We know that the treacherous datura is a hallucinogenic, but this reminds us of a different altered state – that of being madly, wildly, obsessively in love. Like the song you can't get out of your head, or the face you cannot stop picturing – this is a fragrance you cannot forget."," Myrrh, bitter almond, tonka bean, musk, osmanthus, heliotrope, mandarin, lemon blossom, tuberose, vanilla, coconut oil, apricot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36114.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Geisha Noire Eau de Parfum,Aroma M," This wickedly seductive blend of amber, sandalwood and tonka bean is getting a makeover due to popular demand. Since its debut in 2000, Geisha Noire has built up a fiercely loyal following of women and men who have fallen under the spell of this dark and intriguing fragrance oil. While they loved the oil, many requested an eau de parfum be made with the same intense film noir mystique, but perhaps a bit more sillage. Geisha noir eau de parfum has the same hypnotic blend of elegance and danger – but the added presence of alcohol serves to lighten it up and give it some breathing space.  In aromatherapy terms, Geisha Noir helps to combat stress, clear the mind and loosen inhibitions. We can vouch for that last one. A fragrance to make you feel divinely reckless."," black amber, sandalwood, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11128.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Osmanthus Interdite Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Osmanthus Interdite, a new fragrance in the Parfum d'Empire collection of fragrances inspired by great empires of the past, is an ode to Chinese Empire, to ancestral wisdom and to a small white flower of a delicate pallor that expresses purity, serenity and stability – osmanthus. The scent opens on a rich Chinese tea note woven around the complex and ethereal osmanthus with its unique combination of floral and slightly fruity, apricot-like aromas. We especially adore the fruity aspect of this unusual flower and think that those who, like us, have been searching for a slightly fruity, sweet osmanthus, have found their match. The gently honeyed, apricot-scented blossoms smell luscious and blissful; we can't explain it, but the aroma of Osmanthus Interdite makes us happy and content. Enriched by rose and jasmine sambac, in the heart of the fragrance, osmanthus becomes sensual and velvety, mingling its fruity notes with the crystalline purity of the musks. Delicate and alluring, the fragrance is joyful and tranquil...a secret blossoming oasis of beauty in the midst of our busy modern life."," Chinese tea, osmanthus, rose, jasmine, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Equistrius Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," With Equistrius, the perfumer Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, a competition equestrian, pays tribute to Equistrius, the“bright and gleaming horse” which helped him win his most glorious victories, to the legendary Roman Empire and to orris, one of the most precious raw materials used in perfumery. Well-known in Roman times, it was widely used in pharmacy because of its soothing and calming properties. In elegant and noble Equistrius, a scent truly fit for Roman Gods, the orris speaks majestically. This year brought us a whole plethora of iris scents, and we liked many of them, but it was the refined, enthralling aroma of Equistrius that took our hearts and minds captive. The fragrance combines powdery softness of“rice powder”, the floral delicacy of violet and the unexpected warmth of chocolate to reveal the exquisite facets of the complex aroma of orris. Ambrette butter, rare and intense, with its languid musky notes, adds sensuality to the soft, intimate blend. Rich and sophisticated, ambergris and sandalwood give Equistrius its addictive, mesmerizing appeal. Forever-changing, deep and intricate, this is the orris scent to rule all orris scents, a gift for the true connoisseurs."," Orris, violet, rice powder, chocolate, ambrette, sandalwood, vetiver, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere Bengale Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Inspired by the Bengal part of the Ancient Mongol Empire, the warm and animalic notes of Fougere Bengale recount the famous Bengalese tiger hunts in the heart of the Assam jungle where the humidity is permeated with the odor of hay. With Fougere Bengale, Parfum d'Empire also reinterpret the fougere genre by adding to the traditional blend of lavender, tonka bean and oakmoss a sensual and honeyed tobacco accord and a mouthwatering gingerbread note. Is it a fougere? For sure! But the sophisticated, subtle gourmand-ness adds a surprising and extremely enchanting twist to the classic composition. The fragrance opens with the freshness of lavender, so popular with the English dandies. Then, the dry warm notes of hay take us to Bengal, to the Assam tea plantations. The mild tobacco, a glimpse of the British officers' cigarettes, mingles with the animalic scents of the Indian brushlands. Finally Fougere Bengale welcomes us to an oriental palace where the enigmatic patchouli, vanilla and tonka bean evoke silk and cashmere. This suave, mysterious scent with animal sensuality, a blend of traditional and modern, will be equally adored by lovers of the impeccably classic perfumes and the offbeat, unusual contemporary creations."," Lavender, tarragon, patchouli, geranium, tobacco, tonka beans, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Tourmaline Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," Black Tourmaline is Olivier Durbano's third entry into his gemstone-inspired“perfume poems.”  Decadent yet spiritual, it's a resinous and sweet smoky scent that Durbano has built around the legendary stone of protection.  Burned wood, sweet smoke, rich oud and dried spice unfurl in a reverent ceremony, while earthy notes of patchouli, moss and leather provide a fragrant anchor to its otherworldly mystery.  Black Tourmaline is the scent of a confessional, hauntingly beautiful with its ethereal sweet incense and smoky tones and earthbound with its base notes...one foot in the unknown and one in the here and now."," Cardamom, coriander, cumin, frankincense, pepper, smoked wood, oud, leather, precious woods, musk, amber, moss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Olibanum Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Stone walls, gothic archways, flickering candles and chanting voices– all of these are evoked by Olibanum's fierce opening salvo of incense. But the single strongest image is that of intense purification – of intricate curls of white smoke seeking out and banishing whatever malevolent spirits have gathered in the shadows.  This austere beauty mellows into a calm and soothing scent with soft orange blossom emphasizing the airy, floating aspects of the incense and a base of warm and reassuring sandalwood.  Lovely and wearable, but with an undercurrent of power and mystery that keeps it infinitely intriguing."," incense, myrrh, orange blossom, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33920.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acqua Viva Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Find a lemon tree, pick a brilliant yellow fruit still warm from the sunshine, give it a gentle squeeze to release the oils in the rind, close your eyes and sniff – that is Acqua Viva. This is the most amazingly authentic lemon scent we have ever found. It is the bracing scent of the zest – intense, bright and clean and without a drop of sugar in it. These are lemons that are still on a tree, surrounded by cypress and cedar, overlooking the dazzling Mediterranean Sea. The air is fresh, the sky is blue and life is good. Acqua Viva uses Amalfi lemons – the queen of lemons – grown on terraced hillsides and famed for their intense scent and flavor.

Chocolate Greedy Eau de Parfum,Montale," Chocolate connoisseurs that we are, we prefer our chocolate to be dark, but sometimes we just cannot resist the guilty pleasure of creamy milkiness. It is no wonder that we adore Chocolate Greedy, because it amazingly combines the dark and the creamy aspects of chocolate. The beginning of Chocolate Greedy is a mouthwatering ode to delectable creaminess, a luscious, rich ganache of incredible scrumptiousness. The middle stage has an attractive hint of powderiness that makes us think of the highest-quality cocoa generously sprinkled on very expensive truffles with a subtle undertone of bitter orange. The chocolate creaminess turns the drydown of Chocolate Greedy into an exquisitely, subtly gourmand skin scent, delicate, enveloping and very sensual. A must have for chocoholics, which is to say, a must have for everybody!"," tonka bean, bitter orange, cacao cream, vanilla from Madagascar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau de L'Artisan Eau de Toilette,L'Artisan Parfumeur," L'Artisan Parfumeur's signature scent, created by the celebrated perfumer Olivia Giacobetti, is one of the most elegant fresh compositions, a scent as refined as it is charmingly rustic. This blend of bright citruses, cool mint, refreshing herbal greenness of basil, juicy verdancy of grass and subtly saline briskness of seaweed is our weapon of choice to fight the heat of summer and the scent that we come to in winter to be reminded of the warm, sun-lit days. We love the fact that the freshness of L'Eau de L'Artisan is never sharp; wearing the fragrance is akin to being cooled by the delicate breeze coming from the sea, the breeze that brings the aroma of grassy fields, of hay, of lemons and herbs... Ah, bliss!"," lemon, verbena, mint, basil, fresh-cut grass, seaweed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/15241.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Alba Eau de Parfum,Profumum," The perfect antidote to a stressful day. This incredibly comforting scent takes rich, warm woods – almond wood, hazel wood and sandalwood -- and blends them with powdery amber to create a cashmere soft fragrance that caresses the senses.   Alba means dawn, and this is sunrise in a pristine forest – hushed and tranquil. Pine needles cover the forest floor; there is a circle of ancient oaks and a pile of moss covered stones. The cool gray mist slowly melts away as the hazy sunlight begins to filter in at the edges and touch the forest with rose and gold. Reassuring and subtle – the woods and powder warm together on the skin like the trees in the sunshine. Peaceful and cozy."," sandalwood, hazel wood, almond wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33918.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blu Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," A brilliant take on tuberose that makes the most of her persistent, extravagantly feminine, take-no-prisoners beauty. An extraction of the very heart of tuberose – creamy, lush and intense –  is  brightened with a fresh fizz of orange and warmed with soothing sandalwood.  Overtly girlish at the beginning, Blu mellows into something otherworldly and dreamlike -- it feels like you are floating in  tropical water, with the sounds of the real world muffled and distant. The tuberose never fades away or becomes overwhelming, but steadily holds it's pure, bell-like note as you drift away on the glittering aquamarine sea. This perfume oil is tinted the brilliant blue of its inspiration, the sea at Capri. Bewitchingly lovely."," Tuberose, Orange, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," This captures that fleeting moment of jasmine in full bloom on a hot August night and magically makes it last and last. A thrillingly true jasmine scent – there is an initital headiness to its breathtaking beauty that shocks the senses momentarily, before wrapping you in veil of ethereal lovliness. All the contrasts that make jasmine so mesmerizing are here: delicate, but sensuous; soft, but intoxicating. This melts into the skin in the most exquisite way, leaving you with an enchanting jasmine-scented aura that lets you pass through the world like a tropical breeze.

Musc Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora," Every once in a while we encounter a fragrance that we instantly recognize as a forever-love and this is one of them. This is a truly superlative musk scent –  deep, spicy and drop dead sexy. This isn't  soft, sheer, clean musk – this is dramatic, untamed, sensuous musk that will get you noticed when you walk into the room and make the object of your desire weak in the knees. If it isn't the best musk ever, it's certainly in the running for that title, and there isn't a one of us here at Luckyscent who didn't stockpile this little number immediately.  An astonishing unisex scent which accomplishes that rare feat of being equally alluring on a man or a woman. Absolutely stunning."," Musk, Rose, Violet, Vanilla, Cloves, Amber, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Aoud Eau de Parfum,Montale," A soft and insinuating take on the mystical aoud.  The opening is powdery and slightly antiseptic, but this fragrance quickly blooms on the skin – gentle roses, delicate spices and ethereal incense on a creamy bed of amber and sandalwood. A judicious swirl of sweet vanilla smoothes out the blend, but never takes over the scent.  If you love Black Aoud, but find it too intense for everyday wear, this is the answer. Do not be alarmed – all of this creamy softness has not banished the compelling complexity of the oud. It is still here, sensuous and edgy and dream inducing, making this a comfort scent that will never be mistaken for ordinary.  Our fragrance geek side marvels at how perfectly balanced this is, our diva side just wants to wear it because it's gorgeous.

Rock Crystal Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano," Cristal de Roche (Rock Crystal) is the first of Durbano's“perfume poems, ” an enigmatic scent inspired by the myth surrounding rock crystal and the magical,  mystical aura of frankincense.  Centuries ago,  rock crystal was thought to be ice that could not be melted; this mineral represents the link between man and nature,  the notion of man's place within the universe and the union of man with a higher force.  Frankincense,  a resinous substance venerated for centuries in places of worship,  is thought to carry prayers uttered by mortals towards the heavens. Durbano brings this to the forefront of Cristal de Roche,  as incense and resins of frankincense,  olibanum,  benzoin and myrrh rise like columns of deeply fragrant smoke to symbolise the joining of heaven and earth. A rich,  deep scent,  Cristal is not for the faint of heart; it's a marriage of moody woods,  deep incenses and dried spices,  a perfume for lovers of deep and“churchy” fragrances – for those who love deep gold brocades and dark red satins versus crisp white linens and freshly starched cottons...for those who love the scented rituals of mankind in search of the divine."," orange, pepper, coriander, cardamom, cumin, olibanum, benzoin, myrrh, cistus, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, everlasting flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tuberosa Eau de Parfum,Profumum," We would call this a straightforward tuberose if it weren't for the fact that there is nothing straightforward about tuberose. Ever. It flirts, it teases, it beckons, it distracts, it wraps you around its little finger and whispers sweet nothings in your ear. It keeps you from concentrating on anything practical  and tries to convince you to run off for the weekend. This is tuberose at  her most bewitching”” heady and creamy and fresh, with a flourish of white jasmine and a tantalizing whisper of something warm and spicy that gives this a playfulness that many big florals lack. And make no mistake, this is a big floral. A big, flirtatious, impossible-to-resist floral that will make heads swivel. Outrageously feminine."," Tuberose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Victrix Eau de Parfum,Profumum," An uplifting scent as crisp and refreshing as a cool wind whipping across an open field. The scintillating pink pepper opening is tamed with earthy vetiver, green laurel and fresh musk for a blend that speaks of broad stretches of undeveloped land and impossibly clean skies. Victrix has an elemental quality: a tingling spiciness that feels like a storm far off on the horizon; the mysterious dark, piny scent of a forest where no tree has ever been cut; the rough coolness of stark  expanses of earth and stone. Named for a legion of Ancient Rome, this has a nobility and strength that speaks to another time, but the insistent bite of pepper keeps this thoroughly modern and completely compelling. Commanding and masculine."," Pink pepper, vetiver, laurel, coriander, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33916.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Aurea Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Pure, deep amber at its luxurious best. When you strip it down to the basics, it's all about the quality of the ingredients. A simple chain made out of something that looks like gold is one thing; a simple chain made out of pure gold is another thing entirely. Ambra Aurea is like a beautifully made, 24 karat gold chain”” gorgeous and timeless and perfect. Its velvety warmth has the thrilling resonance of a heavy church bell ringing -- you feel it to the soles of your feet. Like all of the truly divine ambers, this is dizzyingly sensuous, but its simplicity keeps it elegant. Less sweet and less playful than Profumum's Fiori d'ambra, Ambra Aurea is a classic amber with a bit of powder and a quiet sexiness. If you love amber, you should try them both”” it's a win/win situation.", Grey amber absolute (we're pretty sure there's more to it),https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33917.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Promesse de l'Aube Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Francis  Kurkdjian's first creation for MDCI, Promesse de l'Aube is a scent for the morning,“a classical and refined oriental-floral”. Its top notes of mandarin and lemon are fresh, and have a joyful, flirty, sun-kissed feel. The citruses have a candied quality, which teasingly hints at the delicious sweetness, but never steps into the realm of the gourmand. The heart of the composition is a luxurious, creamy bouquet of ylang-ylang and jasmine. It is languid, summery, warmed by the tropical sun. The base features a gorgeous blend of velvety sandalwood sweetened and softened by vanilla. The scent combines playfulness, the allusion to the tropical exoticism with the supremely elegant, urban side. We are absolutely smitten with this charming fragrance and know that you will be too."," Mandarin, lemon, ylang-ylang, jasmine, sandalwood, tonka bean and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose de Siwa Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Rose de Siwa is a woody-floral scent for“moments doux” (soft moments). Named after the flowers of the Siwa Oasis in Egypt, the perfume is delicate and fresh, truly an exhausted traveler's dream of a paradise in the midst of a hot desert...with beautiful fountains, and luxurious trees and roses fresh with the morning dew. The scent is a charming, playful rhapsody in pink, a joyful, flirty, truly feminine composition that features pink peonies, pink roses, and pink fruits, with violets adding a darker depth to the blend. It winks, it smiles, it twirls in its gauzy, pink dress...what a little charmer!"," Lychee, peony, hawthorn, Moroccan and Turkish roses, violet, cedar, musk and vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Topkapi Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," Created by the renowned perfumer Pierre Bourdon, the first MDCI fragrance for men, Ambre Topkapi was meant to embody strength, power and wealth, and was inspired by the striking figure crowning the men's flacon. The scent, with its bracing and strapping notes, is forceful and daring. We admire the way the tradition and modernity meet and intertwine in this handsome, truly regal composition. The top notes are the perfumer's nod to the classic masculine scents: the beginning of Ambre Topkapi is brightened by bergamot, spiced up by ginger and have a cool, herbal undertone of basil, thyme and lavender. The heart notes, with their combination of luxurious leather and soft, sweet sandalwood, add depth, warmth and what we can only described as a very“expensive” feel to the blend. In the base, vanilla and amber ornament the scent beautifully, bringing to it a wonderfully exotic feel, making it evocative of faraway lands, luxurious palaces, and Eastern splendor. This unexpected exoticism is where the traditional meets modern. This ambery-vanillic warmth is also what should make Ambre Topkapi wearable for women as well as for men."," Bergamot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg ginger, basil, thyme, lavender, oak moss, vetiver, sandalwood, rosewood, leather, Darjeeling tea, amber, musk, vanilla, jasmine and violet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Invasion Barbare Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI," A masculine scent created by a young and talented female perfumer, StÃ©phanie Bakouche, Invasion Barbare is an elegant and soulful portrait of a man of every woman's dream. He exudes warmth, intelligence and sensitivity as well as strength. And yet, sensitive as he is, there is a passionate Barbarian hidden under his refined exterior. Like that ”˜Perfect Man', Invasion Barbare combines elegant understatement with lots of warmth and an unexpected, mesmerizing depth. The composition is built on the contrast of freshness and warmth, on the intriguing balance of citrus fruits, lavender, spices and vanilla and woods. Invasion Barbare is a tranquil, comforting scent, as soft as it is piquant. It is a soft-spoken fragrance, there is nothing overly forceful about it, and yet it is full  of charisma. One gentle whiff of its delicately-spiced notes and we are enthralled. We strongly believe that this beautiful blend might and should be used as a shared fragrance."," Grapefruit, bergamot, violet leaves, white thyme, cardamom, lavender, ginger, cedarwood, vanilla and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Farine Eau de Toilette,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Created by Jean-Claude Ellena, perfume composer of international fame, Bois Farine (Wood Flour) is the product of his encounter with a magic tree in the Reunion Islands. Here, in a forest known as the coloured wood forest, surrounded by evocatively named trees , red wood, yellow wood, iron wood and milk wood, he unexpectedly discovered the fragrant white tree - a rare and nowadays protected species, reputed to have magical powers.

Private Collection: L'Ombre Fauve Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Sensual, feline and ever so slightly bestial, L'Ombre Fauve is an unapologetically sumptuous blend, which contains a high level of natural  ingredients. It smells brooding and luscious; its amber is fantastically opulent, a complex, mesmerizing note which possess balsamic, sweet and incense-like facets. Precious woods, the presence of which is apparent from the very start, smell dry and a little spicy. The musk is warm and sensual, and patchouli, which is our most favorite part of this gorgeous scent, adds to the blend an earthy, nocturnal, downright erotic quality. L'Ombre Fauve is exotic and refined, a satisfyingly rich perfume with a beguiling trail. There is something about this sensual scent that makes our knees a little weak."," amber, musk, woods, incense, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Sultan Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens," Mysterious and strangely moving, Ambre Sultan is the antithesis of the golden, powdery ambers you may be familiar with.  This stunning fragrance is deep, resinous scent, loaded with spices, deep amber, earthy patchouli, dark resins and quiet vanilla, all of which combine to make a visceral and raw scent experience.  It's a trip to a Bedouin tent in a desert far away and stealing a look inside...thick incense burning on coal with spices filling the air, mysterious eyes flashing and a very real feeling that you've never smelled anything like this magnificent amber perfume before.  A devilishly dark aroma that goes beyond sensual or coy, Ambre Sultan is flat out oozing sexuality, deeply exotic and utterly, totally and completely unforgettable.  Once you smell it, it will haunt your dreams until you find your way back to it."," coriander, amber, oregano, bay leaf, myrtle, angelica root, sandalwood, patchouli, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tubereuse Couture Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Created in the spirit of High Fashion, Tubereuse Couture is an exotic and elegant fragrance, which contrasts the creamy beauty of tuberose with the mouthwatering, green sweetness of kalamanzi and sugar cane. The striking juxtaposition starts in the top notes, where the tangy fruitiness of citrus is combined with the languorous floral notes of tuberose and ylang-ylang. Ylang-ylang is apparent at all stages of the scent's development and serves to emphasize and strengthen the velvety, enveloping quality of the tuberose. The sugar cane, on the other hand, adds a fresh aspect to the composition, keeping it from becoming overwhelmingly heady and buttery-sweet, as so many tuberose scents are prone to do. The base notes of Tubereuse Couture are resinous, a little powdery,  and like the rest of this fashionable blend, very refined."," kalamanzi oil, green jasmine shoots, ylang-ylang, sugar cane, Indian tuberose, Sumatra benzoin, papyrus.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34517.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

She is that little black dress - your secret weapon. Confident and sexy, the world at the tips of her fingers. When she walks into a room people take notice. Bergamot takes the opening bow while a warm opulent amber envelopes orange, vanilla and musk folding them into sheer amber perfection. Geraniums take center stage flushed with a touch of patchouli.

A classic."," Bergamot, amber, patchouli, geranium, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
AMAZE Parfum Eau de Parfum,People of the Labyrinths," To say this fragrance has been highly anticipated would be an understatement. The first fragrance from People of the Labyrinths, Luctor et Emergo, has a rabid cult following that includes all of us here at Luckyscent and we've spent hours discussing what this line's new scent would be like –“incredibly complex”,“cutting edge”,“something no one expects!” And that last one would be correct, because none of us expected a simple, elegant rose scent.  Saffron and henna warm up the opening and there are soft woods and musk in the mix, but mostly there is rose. Not a bouquet of roses or a rose garden, but a single, perfect, magical rose that we can envision clearly --- it's the enchanted rose in“Beauty and the Beast” floating in its glass dome, wondrous and eternal and glowing. Initially the rose is a bit forceful, but as you wear A*MAZE  it melts into your skin and becomes warm and powdery and subtle, as if you just emerged from a rose petal bath. This is a must-try for rose lovers, and you know who you are, but it will also have a lot of appeal for those who enjoy soft, clean fragrances because the drydown is essentially a rosy skin scent. It has even earned the love of one staffer who has sworn repeatedly that she would never wear a rose fragrance. We told you it was enchanting."," Henna, Saffron, Taif Rose, Orange Blossom, Wardia Rose, Agarwood, Sandalwood, Musk, Civet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Russe Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," The moment we smelled Ambre Russe, we knew that we found our new Holy Grail amber scent. It is a baroque, luxurious perfume; its very notes spell excess. The legendary wealth of the Tsars, the rivers of vodka and champagne, the tea and honey, the sinful leather, the incense burned as an atonement for one's sins ”” it's all here. As rich as it sounds, however, the fragrance is not heavy or overwhelming; the lavish notes are blended masterfully, smoothly, in a composition that is warm, sensual and comforting. After the initial hot blast of amber and incense, a velvety, honey-like accord becomes apparent, along with the feisty and exhilarating 'boozyness', which lightens the mood of this dark brew. The tea note, combined with spices and leather, adds very enjoyable smokiness and emphasizes the full-bodied, darkly-ornate character of Ambre Russe. This is an extravagant, captivating perfume, quite unlike any other scent we have ever experienced."," tea, incense, vodka, champagne, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ambergris, vanilla, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Ottoman Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Cuir Ottoman, inspired by 'the erotism and the mystery of the East', is a leather perfume extraordinaire, forceful, elegant and extremely sensual. The powerful impact of the leather is softened by a bright and sweet orris note and ornamented beautifully by jasmine, herbs and incense. A sweet, balsamic leitmotif is always present in the background, perfectly balancing the  potent brutality of leather. The scent, which is slightly animalic, resinous and warm, does indeed evoke the Ottoman splendor, dirt and sensuality. Mysterious, alluring and full of character, Cuir Ottoman is one of our most favorite leather scents."," jasmine, leather, iris, benzoin, balsams, resins, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Suave Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Eau Suave was inspired by Empress Josephine, Napoleon's one true love, and her affection for roses. Sophisticated and warm, Eau Suave is the scent of dark-red flowers basking in the golden glow of spices, sweetened by honeyed apricots, peaches and raspberries. Sensual, decadent and oh so elegant, Eau Suave is one of the most gorgeous rose scents we have ever encountered. Complex and multi-faceted, this noble beauty is not your average rose soliflore. Absolutely exquisite."," pepper, coriander, saffron, Rose de Malmaison, apricot, raspberry, peach, vanilla and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iskander Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Iskander, dedicated to Alexander the Great, is a bracing and fresh fragrance with a slightly spicy and surprisingly warm and earthy undertone. The citrus notes are bright and tangy, the spices are sweetly-piquant, and the musk has an animalic side that we adore. The base of Iskander, with its oakmoss and amber, displays an unexpected, chypre-like, quality and a classic, understated elegance. Minimalist, uncluttered and full of character, Iskander is a scent truly worthy of the Great Conqueror himself."," citron, mandarin, grapefruit, estragon, coriander, orange blossom, oakmoss,  amber and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soavissima Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Elegant and gentle, this is the slipper-footed princess of powder scents tiptoeing about her boudoir, draped in gleaming satin with a flounce of lacy sweetness following her in a puff. Delicate, powdery white flowers with a rose-like air melt seamlessly into powdery amber and are enhanced with ... well, more powder. Yes, there is a lot of powder here and it's all blended with a deft hand that emphasizes its soft, refined femininity. As the initial puffy cloud aspect settles, this dries down to a warm and nostalgic comfort scent that lives up to its name, which translates as“super smooth”. Ladylike and lovely."," powdery notes, white flowers, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33911.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Confetto Eau de Parfum,Profumum," An absolutely gorgeous rendition of almond that teases us with glimpses of bitterness glittering darkly behind the expected sweetness, keeping us unsettled and intrigued and coming back for more. Not that sweetness isn't present in Confetto – it's there, but it's complicated. Without its frequent companions vanilla and rose, almond is less of a comfort food and more of a provocative elixir. A pronounced anise note coaxes out its sensuous side and a soft bed of amber and musk lead it even further away from candyland. For us, Confetto's mesmerizing blend of sugar and shadow created an instant craving and left us weak in the knees. Bewitching."," sugared almond, amber, musk, hint of anise",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dulcis in Fundo Eau de Parfum,Profumum," This opens with a very fresh, very sweet orange, like a clementine being peeled, complete with the tangy sharpness of citrus oil on your fingers. Then the sweetness intensifies and becomes richer, as if drizzled with Grand Marnier, and a billowy dollop of luscious, creamy, unadulterated vanilla tops it all off. Warm and brazenly sweet, this ambrosial blend is for the woman who wants to smell delicious. This is dessert at its irresistible best: whipped cream being licked off fingers, fits of giggles fueled by liqueur, suggestive whispers over shared spoonfuls. We suspect that more is going on here than citrus and vanilla (some say a saucy little apricot was involved) but perhaps it is just a citrus and a vanilla that get along exceedingly well. Delectable."," Citrus fruits, Mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fumidus Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Fumidus means smoky, and smoky it is. The smokiness of aged Laphroaig scotch served neat, It is also earthy – the earthiness of rich, freshly tilled land surrounded by uncut forest. Deep and magnetic and commanding, this blend of rich peat, grassy vetiver and brisk birch conjures up a vast estate and its moody young lord making his way through the fog on an unruly stallion. It's outdoorsy, but in a way that makes it clear that you don't just work in the forest, you own that forest yourself, along with a good bit of grassland and quite possibly a castle. Unmistakably masculine and very sexy."," Essence of distilled scotch, vetiver root, birch bark",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33914.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cardinal Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," A mesmerizing incense blend that comes dangerously close to putting us into an actual trance. It conjures up a grand, stone-walled cathedral -- not dark, dank or gloomy, but a place of light, majesty and infinite calm. We can envision the dreamy tendrils of smoke rising through sunlight streaming in the stained glass windows and feel the reassuring warmth of wood and sun-warmed stone. Airy incense and resinous cistus intermingle with the deep, sweet earthiness of patchouli and vetiver, creating a fragrance that is both spiritual and grounded. Fans of Comme des Garcon's Incense series (particularly Kyoto and Avignon)  will want to try this, as well anyone who has been longing for an incense scent without gothic overtones. Warm and reassuring."," incense, cistus, grey amber, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Absolu Eau de Parfum,Montale," Smooth and sweet, silky and enveloping, Vanille Absolu is everything you could ever desire in an upscale vanilla: swirly folds of boozy vanilla are set off and enhanced by soft woods and a touch of cinnamon and clove. It's more like the pure distilled essence of a true vanilla bean pod than the wafer cookie vanillas that have flooded the market in the last few years, but make no mistake: this beauty flaunts its sweet depths with wild abandon and really doesn't care who's looking. A refined vanilla without being snooty, we can think of several perfumes that trumpet“vanilla” in their name then try to bury the note under a pile of florals or other notes in an effort to be“classy.”  Montale got it right – there's a reason so many of us love the smell of vanilla, and Vanille Absolu is it.  It's one of the best pure, elegant vanillas on the market. Period."," vanilla, cinnamon, clove, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wood and Spices Eau de Parfum,Montale," A new interpretation on a timeless men's combination (wood and spice), Montale continues to break new ground in finding gorgeous, fragrant ways to surprise us all.  It's both professional and sexy, a wonderfully confusing mix of freshness and depth.  We're quite certain that the notes given to us by Montale are missing an ingredient or two, but if we had to guess, we'd say there's a mysterious citrus in here as a topnote, and we love it. Like the cut of a perfectly tailored shirt worn by a man with confidence who really couldn't care less about decking himself out in the newest, weirdest fashion, Wood & Spices is a very real, modern scent. This one will turn heads – but not because it's freaky, but because it's loaded with class and easy elegance."," ebony, sandalwood, vetiver; incense, cardamom, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intense Tiare Eau de Parfum,Montale," Lush and sweet tiarÃ© flowers are the star of this little slice of paradise, and their voluptuous nature unfurls in a tender, delicate glory that thrilled us with its island charms (and made us want to buy a plane ticket straight to a tropical island). Soft, creamy and sweet, just close your eyes and you're on a white sand beach, breathing in the sweet, hypnotic smell of the native flowers. TiarÃ© is a variety of gardenia, but stands alone from other gardenias as a completely unique flower native to Tahiti””if you've found island loves with beautiful scents like Monyette Paris, we think you just may fall head over heels with Intense TiarÃ©. Totally captivating, this queen of the gardenias fragrance is pure swoon-in-a-bottle."," tiare, ylang-ylang, vanilla, coconut milk, jasmine, roses",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Aoud Eau de Parfum,Montale," Black Aoud is a dramatic fragrance – but don't confuse that with overly strong.  It's medium bodied and very rich, a bubbling potion of velvety rose and the old leather feel of labdanum, mixed with mystical oud tree oils.  It's a rare journey somewhere where you've probably never been and will beg to return to...all it takes is a little whiff of this amazing, rare elixir.  If you seek a deeply incensed rose and sandalwood fragrance, one that would have scented the brightly dyed pillows of a harem, you need look no further."," Red rose, aoud, labdanum, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aoud Cuir d'Arabie Eau de Parfum,Montale," Oud Cuir d'Arabie is a classy whip crackin' leather,  a“pay attention to me” leather, a seductive and carnal perfume which demands a wearer with the personality to make it their own and then, look out world! The notes of oud are on full display in all their strength and softness in this scent, a truly rare thing to behold in Western perfumery. Strong in character but soft and supple in actual fragrance, Oud Cuir d'Arabie traps you with its initial opening, taking you from a raw leather straight into soft, buttery glove-like leather. By then, you're completely hooked...and when the oud warms to your skin and begins to thrill you with its unique, resinous nature, you're completely, utterly, willingly enslaved."," tobacco, leather and burnt wood dry notes, here the Oud produces all of its strength and softness.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35411.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

L'eau de Circe Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The legend of Circe, an enchantress in the mythological tale of the Odyssey, greatly inspired the perfumer: She caused the loss of Ulysses' companions through her magic spells. Eau de CircÃ© is a 'magic potion' exploring a new kind of Oriental perfume: light, aerian with transparency, an evanescent oriental. Captivating and magnetic, it draws it mystery from a precious floral blend of Absolute of Damask Rose, Jasmine, Osmanthus, Orchid, Ylang-ylang, white Peach leaves and Tangerine. Sensual and scheming with Patchouli, Wood and Amber, the warm, caressing Honey Balm brings light and delicate sweetness to the scent."," Damask rose, jasmine, osmanthus, orchid, ylang-ylang, white peach leaf, tangerine, patchouli, wooden accords, and amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Musc Maori Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Mouth watering... Milky-smooth Cumaru wood is refreshed with green notes of coffee tree blossom presiding over a contrasting accord on a black and white theme; white musk and cocoa bean come together in an unexpected harmony. The sweet, powdery smoothness of the latter, echoed by vanilla-scented Amber and Tonka Bean, respond to the pure and soberly sensual effect of the former.

To start with, an aromatic note of Brazilian rosewood and greenery. The magic of a perfume within a perfume, an ever-changing harmony which we have called 'Rose Day' recalling the flower's life cycle: the fresh, pearly, almost lemon-scented bud, then the new bloom, subtly modulating from the ethereal fragrance at its heart to the romance of its petals. Finally the mature flower, a potent trail of fragrance-- warm and heady-- all these elements are blended with rose amber and raspberry musk by a velvety harmony of vanilla and cocoa.","Brazilian Rosewood, Rose Buds, Litchi, Raspberry, Sandalwood, Amber, Vanilla, Cocoa",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Venenum Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," We are almost tempted to not tell you how fabulous it is so we can store all the bottles in the world in our own private collections and never, ever share a drop. Cuir Venenum is a somber and opulent brew, utterly captivating and, pardon us while we furiously blush, but truly, madly and deeply erotic.  Sweet, soft leather...none of the ”˜whip me' strong notes of a new, brash leather. This is soft, expensive leather””mixed with a honeyed ”˜burnt jam' musk and a sweet, sacred myrrh. And into that sensual and holy mix is added absolute of orange blossom...but it's not a distracting mix of heady blossoms.

Humid, moist air is swept away by the harmattan and replaced with cooler, dryer air, a feat perfectly captured in this magical perfume of the dunes.

This is the type of fragrance that will make you wonder at its depths (black tea), make you smile (citrus) and make you comforted (soft wood) all at the same time.

PG has the exclusive rights to this new extraction of the oil, which presents itself as a captivating rich, warm, super spicy wood.

Geisha Marron roll-on Perfume Oil,Aroma M," Geisha Marron takes its inspiration not only from the scent of chestnut blossoms, but also from that even more widespread flavor of spring... of white flowers and to musk brown (marron, in French). Brown is surely the most underserved color in all of perfumery.  More than any other, it evokes the musty scent of succulent overripeness, of sweetness that dares to skirt the edge of seductive decay. That is Geisha Marron's most unique quality."," grapefruit, mandarin, bergamot, muguet, japanese magnolia, chestnut blossom (white flower)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11124.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dzongkha Eau de Toilette,L'Artisan Parfumeur," An incredibly powerful and evocative fragrance composed for l'Artisan Parfumeur by Bertrand Duchaufour. A perfumer who has the passion for travels and who already created Timbuktu inspired by Africa. This time, he drew inspiration from a journey in Bhutan, a little Kingdom located in Eastern Himalayas, between India and China. He composed Dzongkha, a mysterious fragrance inspired by the smell of the stones and incense of the Buddhist temples (the Dzongks), with notes of tanned leather, smoked tea and the evocation of fire places - around which life is organized since the climate is very hard in this region. A fragrance also evocative of the smell of refined flowers that grows in this extraordinarily preserved nature.A bewildering fragrance, an invitation to spirituality and an inside journey. Its enveloping trail is unexpected, simultaneously intimate and present. This fragrance speaks to both women and men and tells a unique story on each skin: that of Dzongkha, the language of Bhutan. In the top note of Dzongkha, the freshness of peonies and the pink flavor of lychees vibrate with cardamom. The heart of the fragrance is accompanied by chai notes (spicy tea with milk) that soften the strength of wood where vetiver stands out in the fumes of incense. This intensity is accentuated by cypriol (Indian papyrus) and leather notes.

Fiore d'Ambra Eau de Parfum,Profumum," An unrushed and langorous amber  with dreamy wisps of opium... unmade beds and staying up all hours... long conversations with whispers and giggles and wine... days that start in the afternoon.  A trace of smooth vanillic sweetness makes this too cozy to be outright wicked, but we strongly suspect that it is up to no good. Playfully spicy in the opening, this stretches out like a sleepy cat and becomes mellow, creamy and mesmerizing. Sensuous without being overpowering, this is an exceptionally easy-to-wear  and versatile amber. It's amazing on both men and women, it works for day or at night. A stunner."," amber gris, opium",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thundra Eau de Parfum,Profumum," A solitary walk through a cool, damp forest, just after the rain. You can smell the rich earth as it drinks in the water, the bark on the trees, the carpet of fallen leaves and wild mint crushed under your feet. An unexpectedly cool and introspective rendition of patchouli, as peaceful and inspiring as the air after a thunderstorm has broken a heat wave. The warm earthiness of the patchouli is perfectly juxtaposed with the equally grounded, but chilly mint to create a unique and surprisingly relaxing fragrance. Thoughtful and serene."," leaves, mint, patchouli, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

You can almost hear the gulls and feel the cool mist on your face. This is a not a vague watery floral or a beachy blast of tanning lotion”” this is the ocean itself. Soft woods keep Aqua di Sale from ever becoming harsh or stridently ozonic and there is an undercurrent of extremely subtle sweetness. Instead of a beach teeming with sun bronzed bodies and ice cream vendors, picture a wild, unpopulated stretch of coastline where you can feel the power of the sea and the serenity of being far from the madding crowd."," aroma of salt on the skin, myrtle, cedarwood, marine algae",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Imagine a long stretch of rugged coastline, the crash of emerald waves against the rocky shore and a hot summer wind stirring up all the tantalizing scents of the amazing Mediterranean flora. The predominant note here is fig – a warm, dry fig with a deep, satisfying sweetness that mingles with wood, freshly cut grass and sharp myrtle. This smells like the last days of summer , when green has turned to gold and fruit is ripening in the bright sun. Very different from green or milky fig scents, this wild and windswept version is a must-try for all fig lovers."," myrtle, fig-tree wood, cut grass",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The ephemeral beauty of orange blossom- an especially lovely and true orange blossom, by the way- is dipped in vanilla and sugar and laced with a dash of just-on-the-verge-of-tart wild berries. As airy as a meringue, as fragile as first love, this feels like honey melting in your mouth. But don't worry- although this captures the sensation of fleeting beauty, the fragrance itself isn't fleeting. Acqua e Zucchero (”œSugar Water”) is like the memory of that first love, it stays with you awhile. Exquisitely delicious."," orange blossom, wild berries, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouly Eau de Parfum,Profumum," A devastatingly rich and earthy take on patchouli that fully exploits its profound and powerful nature.  Amber helps bring out its irresistible, chewy sweetness that is just this side of narcotic, sandalwood accentuates its warm heart and incense wraps it all in a veil of intrigue.

Antico Caruso Eau de Parfum,Profumum," Inspired by the scent and atmosphere of a classic, old fashioned barbershop: white tiled floors and leather chairs; rich, creamy soaps and brisk herbal tonics; the buzz of good-natured conversation. A vibrant citrus note mingles with the subtle sweetness of almond on a warm base of wood. The result is clean, but in a comforting and luxurious way”” not at all astringent or antiseptic. Antico Caruso brings to mind the good manners and relaxed pace of an earlier time, but has an ease and minimalism that keeps it wearable and modern."," Citrus, almond, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33907.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sel de  Vetiver Eau de Toilette,The Different Company," The sixth perfume in the luxury collection from The Different Company. Sel de Vetiver is the second creation in the line from perfumer Celine Ellena, and can best be described as a smokey-fresh vetiver with hints of patchouli and ylang ylang.

Fleur de Comores Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier," Sultry, smoky, grown-up vanilla swirled with mouth-watering passionfruit and hypnotic jasmine. Fleur de Comores shares many elements with other tropical scents, but it is decidedly not in the frothy, beachy category.  This is deep and edgy and there is a hint of danger in the warm, banana-tinged air. We are far away from resorts and umbrella drinks and venturing deep into exotic territory. We should probably turn back, but we can't pull ourselves away from the creamy, spicy deliciousness of it all.

Musc Bleu Eau de Parfum,Il Profumo," We kept hearing about Musc Bleu from our customers who travel. “I fell in love with this when I was in Italy and I'm dying for more, please carry it! ...and... “I'm desperate and I can't get back to Europe, just now why don't you have Musc Bleu? Intrigued by a fragrance with such diehard fans, we checked it out and instantly became diehard fans ourselves. Musc Bleu is an extraordinarily beautiful, soft, clean musk with a gentle hint of flowers. A simple idea executed extremely well. Sure, you can find floral musks all over the mall, but you would have to search a long, long time before finding one as perfect as this one. Possibly a lifetime. It opens with a light, crystalline freshness and it stays there, which is why it is so wondrous. It retains its delightfully clean airiness for hours without any hint of the musk turning animalic or overpowering. Pure and lovely.

Fou d'Absinthe Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Absinthe – the legendary green fairy, that entrancing vixen that brings visions, addiction and madness. Bacchanalian nights on the Moulin Rouge were fueled by this forbidden wormwood liquor that lives on the razor's edge of bitter and sweet, of cold and hot, of delirium and inspiration. Fou d'Absinthe opens with the steely grip of icy-cool alcohol, enveloped by the distinctive, slightly bitter, unnervingly true note of absinthe, touched with a brisk tingle of angelica. The unique “hot-cold” sensation continues as the crisp, cool bite of anise contrasts with the heat of a cocktail of four spices, before settling into a resinous blend of dry pine, fir balsam and woody cistus. Elegant and mesmerizing, the journey from the initial bracing, herbal sharpness to the deeply sweet and intoxicating mellowness at the end, makes us feel, for just a moment, as if we had actually indulged in contraband. We would follow this green fairy anywhere."," absinthe, star anise, dry pine, cistus, angelica flower, blackcurrant buds, clove, ginger, nutmeg, patchouli, pepper, pine needles, fir balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/15236.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Spiced cocoa, opulent fruits and dark vanilla, its darkly sweet charms lie in the smooth, honey-like chocolate depths. Both dangerously seductive and eye-battingly coy, Chocolat will get you noticed, but only by those very close (in other words, those special people you want to notice)."," mandarin, nutmeg, sandalwood, galbanum, cocoa, plum, jasmine, yellow rose, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/28905.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Green Eau de Parfum,Nanadebary," Nanadebary's take on green is the tender, vibrant green of just sprouted seedlings poking their heads through a tangle of branches. The startlingly fresh green of new bamboo. A brilliantly clear citrus note mingles with basil, cardamom, thyme, and soft musk, creating a fragrance that is as crisp as new stationary, but still feminine and flirtatious enough to suit the kittenish young lass on the bottle.

Geisha Green roll-on perfume oil,Aroma M," A hypnotic metrosexual apéritif unlike anything in our oeuvre. Its key aroma is absinthe---the tart, licorice-flavored liqueur, which we've gently sweetened with black currant, mandarin, and violet, and softened with amber and tonka bean. Famed as an aphrodisiac, absinthe is also a legendary creativity enhancer. Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso, and Hemingway all fell under its spell. And as Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge reminds us, indulging in la fée verte (the green fairy), as absinthe was known in Belle Époque Paris, had such a narcotic effect that cocktail time came to be called l'heure verte (the green hour)—a reference to the potion's dazzling green color."," absinthe, black currant, violet, mandarin, amber, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11117.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

An intoxicating middle note accord of gardenia and paperwhites. These rest on a base note accord of amber, vanilla and musk accented with oakmoss and tobacco flower.

A seductive and delicate blend of iris, wood and Tuscan cypress, Iris de Nuit is a laid back, mellow iris fragrance.  Clean and fluid, its gentle charm evokes modernity--clean spaces, soft angles and crisp white linen, quite different from the classic iris scents of the past.  Perfectly wearable for anytime of day and any situation… Iris de Nuit never screeches its presence, but the air is somehow diminished when the wearer leaves the room.  Memorable and tangible."," white cedar, grey amber, iris, angelica seeds, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Menthe Fraiche Eau de Parfum,HEELEY," A crisp, cold, bracing mint at first, we think we've found the fragrance mint worshippers have been wishing for!

Jasmine, tuberose and orange blossom weave in and around each other like the mesmerizing blur of the white tulle skirts of the corps de ballet.  They waltz, they leap, they merge into an idealized 'white flower' that is not any one of these blooms, but a flower found in a dream. Refined and elegant, this would suit a sylphide or a royal bride equally well. Patricia de Nicolai became the first woman to win the coveted Mouillette d'Or for Best International Perfume Creator when Number One debuted in 1989.

Opening with a tingle of sharp lime and tangerine, this unfurls into a cinnamon-laced, smoky vanilla that makes us deliriously happy. A voluptuous and adult vanilla, a vanilla that has been around the block, a vanilla that has nothing to do with cupcakes.
